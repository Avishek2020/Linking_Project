His music is a perfect equilibrium between high energy beats and unforgettable, harmonic melodies. Memories of the past and visions of tomorrow seamlessly mix in his music. The most intimate and precious thoughts of mankind live in his words.\n\nLeif Erik has been making music since around 1996 under different names. Some years ago Leif Erik recieved a message from Michael Lerman. Togheter they decided to make a song. Michael wrote the lyrics and Leif Erik produced the song. The song wasn't released under the name MoT. Leif Erik and Michael agreed that they should make more songs together, and in a short time the name MoT was choosen for the project, at the same time Margunn Blytt was asked to sing for MoT. She said yes. Today MoT consists of these three, Leif Erik, Michael and Margunn. They try to make melodical trance with meanigful lyrics.\n\nRemember your past, follow your dreams, and join MoT in the quest for memories of tomorrow." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/drevo> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "One thousand years ago with the ward of Christianity to Ukraine the culture on these grounds did not begin anew, but its new page was opened. Alongside with the partially kept prior archaic layers and on their basis, Christianity has formed other original forms of culture, genres and styles.The influence of these processes on national music was especially expressive.\n\nIn pagan times the Kolyadkas (1,4,5,7-11,14,16,18,20,21) and Shchedrivkas (2,15,17,19) were a component of sacramentals related with New Year Day and vernal equinox. In later time Kolyadkas and Shchedrivkas (Christmas carols) became a symbol of Christmastime and other biblical dates and events. Obviously, such reassess of function has served as the reason of a semantic and stylistic variety of Kolyadkas and Shchedrivkas, represented on the disk.\n\nThe content of spiritual verses is always Christian. Their musical stylistics can inherit ancient epic singing-narrative tradition of east Slavs (6). The closest relation with Orthodox Christian religious doctrine and ideology, and also with Church service music is observed in folk canticles (3,12,13) and polychronions (20,22).\n\nThe biblical characters (Jesus Christ, The Theotokos, apostles Peter and Paul, saint George and saint Basil, Herod the king and others), and also place of events in folklore musical compositions as though they are passed through a prism of representation of the Ukrainian peasant consequently get typical features of Ukrainian everyday life.\n\nThe musical stylistics of the folk compositions, represented on the disk, shows different stages of Ukrainian folk singing history. Besides it is caused by the certain regional tradition. The heterophone Kolyadkas and Shchedrivkas from Polissia (North Ukraine) are the most archaic. The manner of their performance is especially ceremonial, and reminds a wail (2,8,11). In other regions of Ukraine such manner of singing is of rare occurrence (15). The characteristics of the later stylistic features are: adding of an independent top voice to a song melody (9,14,17,18); expansion and enriching the canvas with additional voices (1,12). So it forms chord-harmonic canticle style of 17-18 centuries (3,4,5,7,10,13,16,20,22) and change vocal manner to church singing (5,16). Dniper Livoberezhzhia singing (3,7,13) is noticeable for its extended, polyphonically wide style. It is very close to local lyrical singing tradition. In Polissia the singing of winter ceremonial songs could be traditionally accompanied by a violin (8,21).\n\nThis disk represents only small part of a unique musical folklore heritage of Ukrainian people. Tunes were recorded on an audio tape in 1978-1999. All of them were performed by singers from villages of three regions of Ukraine - Pripyat' Polissia, Poltavshchina and Cherkashchina. Ensemble \"Drevo\" has kept features of local musical stylistics (canvas , characteristic sound, a melodic variation, ornamentation) and a language dialect.\n\nThe ensemble \"Drevo\" (founded in Kiev in 1979) has begun the movement for authentic reproduction of traditional peasant music in musical culture of Ukraine. The art director is an ethnomusicologist, the candidate of an art criticism, senior lecturer of National musical academy of Ukraine Eugeny Efremov. The ensemble consists of the young scientists, who collect and investigate traditional national music of different regions of Ukraine - mainly Polissia, Podillia and Livobverezhzhia - for many years. \"Drevo\" recovers the material gathered in ethnographic expeditions without additional art processing, keeping its natural, original form." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/burning_babylon> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Burning Babylon is a one man dub reggae project from Boston, Massachusetts. Created by Slade Anderson, the heavyweight rhythms of Burning Babylon's sound are firmly anchored in the 1970's Jamaican roots tradition, but with an ear for the neo-dub stylings of the present day.\n\nSlade came to dub relatively late in his musical career. For fifteen years he played guitar in various punk/metal bands in the Boston area (The Freeze, Straw Dogs), and at the time, \"heavyweight\" meant snarling guitars and screaming stacks of Marshall amps.\n\nDuring the mid-90's Slade began to play bass seriously, a move that coincided with a decision to investigate reggae. He went in search of a sound more earthy than the mainstream reggae he'd heard, and discovered artists like Glen Brown and King Tubby.\n\n\"It was drums drenched in reverb, horns and guitars echoing into oblivion, and the most heavyweight bass I'd ever heard,\" says Slade.\n\nIt wasn't long before Slade become throughly preoccupied with dub and was deep into study of the rhythms and vibe. Some time later, Slade recorded his first dub track, and Burning Babylon was born.\n\n\"I have my own unique take on dub,\" says Slade, \"but I've certainly been influenced by those that have come before me.\"\n" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/phantasm> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Phantasm, an award-winning quartet of viols, was founded in 1994 by Laurence Dreyfus. Inspired by the great twentieth-century string quartets, Phantasm enjoys taking risks in its search for renditions that renew the expressive traditions of early music. The quartet's international membership (from Britain, Finland and the US) were all trained on modern instruments, but each was drawn to consort playing because of the poignant sound of the viols and the special intimacy this music cultivates. Based in London, Phantasm has toured extensively throughout Europe, North America, and East Asia. They have appeared in festivals in London, York, Berlin, Utrecht, Stavanger, as well as in Iceland, Estonia, Poland and Finland and on concert series in Tokyo, Seoul, New York and Washington.\n\nLaurence Dreyfus, treble viol and director, was born in Boston, Mass. After learning the cello with Leonard Rose at Juilliard, he studied the viol with Wieland Kuijken at the Royal Conservatoire at Brussels, which awarded him its Diplome superieur. As a bass viol player, he has recorded CDs of Bach's viola da gamba sonatas, Marais's Pieces de violes and Rameau's Pieces de clavecin en concert (all on Simax), and collaborated with Silvia McNair in a Grammy-winning album of Purcell songs (on Philips). As a musicologist, Laurence has published Bach's Continuo Group and Bach and the Patterns of Invention (Harvard, 1987 and 1996); the latter won the Kinkeldey Award from the American Musicological Society for the best book of the year. Dreyfus taught at Yale, the University of Chicago, Stanford, and the Royal Academy of Music before becoming Thurston Dart Professor in 1995 at King's College London, where he teaches music history and performance. In 2002 he took British citizenship and was elected a Fellow of the British Academy.\n\nWendy Gillespie, treble viol, was born in New York and, after attending Wellesley College and the Amsterdam Conservatoire, began her performing career with the New York Pro Musica Antiqua. Since then she has played all over the world with leading ensembles including Les Filles de Sainte-Colombe, Ensemble for Early Music, Ensemble Sequentia, the Waverly Consort and the English Concert. She has participated in over 60 recordings for Virgin Classics, Decca, Nonesuch, Harmonia Mundi, among others. Whilst her speciality lies in consort music, Wendy has participated in many performances of both medieval and contemporary music. Wendy is a founding member of the viol consort Fretwork, who appear worldwide and have won a Grand Prix du Disque. Wendy makes her home in Bloomington, where she is Associate Professor at Indiana University and Acting Director of the Early Music Institute.\n\nJonathan Manson, tenor viol, was born in Edinburgh and received his formative training at the International Cello Centre in Scotland under the direction of Jane Cowan, later going on to study with Steven Doane at the Eastman School of Music in New York. While in America, he became involved with the performance of early music, and from there went to The Hague to study viola da gamba with Wieland Kuijken. On both cello and viola da gamba, Jonathan plays and records regularly with many leading early music ensembles. Recent chamber music recordings include a disk of Rameau's Pieces de clavecin en concert with Rachel Podger and Trevor Pinnock. In 1999, he became principal cellist of the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra, which in addition to a busy touring schedule has just finished recording the complete cantatas of JS Bach. Jonathan makes his home outside of London, where he has been appointed a professor at the Royal Academy of Music in London.\n\nMarkku Luolajan-Mikkola, bass viol, studied cello with Arto Noras at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, which awarded him its diploma in 1983. An interest in baroque music led him to a summer course in Norway with Laurence Dreyfus and later to Holland where he studied with Wieland Kuijken at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague and received postgraduate diplomas in viola da gamba and baroque cello. Markku teaches at the Sibelius Academy. He is active as a chamber musician and has given many solo recitals throughout Scandinavia as well as in the Netherlands, Italy, Russia, Estonia, and Poland. His recording of Marais' Suite d'un gout Etranger on ALBA records won a national award for excellence in his native Finland, and other solo CDs have likewise garnered critical acclaim, including discs of virtuoso viol music by Forqueray, Marais, and JS Bach's gamba sonatas, the latter two issued by BIS. A special interest of Luolajan-Mikkola's is contemporary music commissioned for the bass viol.\n\nGuests of Phantasm\n\nSusanna Pell, tenor viol, was born in Leicester and is a member of the viol consort Fretwork and medieval ensemble, The Dufay Collective. With both groups she has toured throughout the world and made many recordings for TV, radio, disc and film. She is also a member of Virelai, an ensemble specialising in music of the late medieval and early renaissance period. Susanna teaches consort playing at King's College London and is currently training to be a teacher of the Alexander Technique.\n\nAsako Morikawa, born in Takamatsu, Japan, started playing viola da gamba when she was 13 years old, but initially studied violin in the Toho Gakuen Music High School in Tokyo, before continuing her studies in viola da gamba at the Conservatorium with Tetsuya Nakano. In 1988 she moved to Holland to further her studies with Wieland Kuijken at the Royal Conservatorium in The Hague, where she received her Soloist's Diploma in 1993. Since 1997 she has made her home in London and has appeared internationally with groups such as Charivari Agreable, The English Concert, The King's Consort, and Fretwork." .

His tracks feature Asian and Middle Eastern beats whirling around Ecker's highly crafted vocal amalgamations in a heavily spiced mix of jazz, funk, and traditional beats. Others feature electronic rhythms and light atmospheric sounds: everything from the roaring sea to classical voices. If there's any one defining feature of Ecker's music it's fluidity, in fact, and his ability to blend cultures and continents so seamlessly is relevant in an ever more mobile and rapidly evolving society.\n\nEcker has been influenced by such artists as Peter Gabriel, King Crimson, Frank Zappa, Fred Frith, Aqsak Maboul, COS/Daniel Schell or Dead Can Dance. He lives in near Bonn/Germany and plays drums, bass, guitar, piano and various electronic devices. He gained musical knowledge and experiences as a member of several bands until he started his solo career in the late 1980's. In 1986 he reached his first international success with Perfume of Love as a member of the dance group Skala. During the 90's, he worked alone and developed his unique electronic world music style.\n" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/bledsoe> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "I was born to loving but rather unmusical parents. My father's singing repertoire was limited to \"The Old Gray Mare\" performed with a toneless and impish gusto which I only heard two or three times that I can recall. My mother tells me she used to be able to pick out tunes on the piano one-handed. As a high school senior I bought my first album: \"Al Hirt Plays the Theme from The Green Hornet.\" I plead humble beginnings.\n\nMy freshman year at college I received an all-important Christmas gift: a $13.95 guitar from JC Penneys. This may sound like the apocrypha of a slightly disoriented blues musician, but I have friends who will swear to the truth of it. And like all new and dedicated players, I played it until my fingers were ragged and sore if not actually bleeding.\n\nUnder the influence of the devil instrument my musical tastes expanded beyond the themes of television shows. At first, I learned to play the music of Mississippi John Hurt, John Fahey, and then as my skill increased, Leo Kottke and Ton Van Bergeyk. Even from the beginning though I wrote my own tunes-albeit in the styles of others. Over several decades I listened to classical, jazz-fusion, pop-rock, and many other kinds of music which had nothing to do with guitars.\n\nAfter trying my hand at many different careers including store clerk, chemical technician at a steel mill, raw materials sampler, custodian, musical instruments sales- and repair-person, house husband, art gallery director, artist-in-residence, semi-pro musician and T'ai Chi instructor, I settled on elementary school teacher. Part of my training as a teacher included a class on educational technology. Technology and learning quickly became my area of expertise, and today I am Educational Technologist (a noble-sounding title for a catch-all plate of responsibilities) in the Molalla River School District in Oregon. I also write monthly technology and education columns for several different teacher publications. In the mid-90's, I discovered digital sound design. My music world went sploosh. And maybe squish, too. Brace yourself, brothers and sisters. I gave up fingerpicking." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/psychokinetics> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Hailing from the astoundingly talented depths of the Bay Area's independent music scene, Psychokinetics have been moving crowds with their bangin' beats, positive vibes, and distinct brand of underground hip-hop since 1995. Delivering hip-hop in its most pure and creative state, this classic recipe of one DJ (Denizen) and two Emcees (Celsius 7 and Spidey) provide consistent heat that has been attracting not only a larger fan base of late, but also an impressive string of musical cameos and collaborators such as Omega of Blackalicious and Raashan Ahmad of Crown City Rockers.\n\nDrawing on a wide range of production talent (DJ Denizen, DJ Ill Media, Dirt Nasty, and Slurface Tone), Psychokinetics are known for delivering a catchy underground sound that appeals to fans of Gorillaz, Ghostface Killah, and De La Soul. With styles ranging from bass heavy party anthems and rhymes flipped over jungle beats to downtempo reflective tracks and scratch laden instrumentals, Psychokinetics constantly demonstrate all the many the benefits of their long histories as musicians together; Celcius 7 and Spidey have amazing back-and-forth flow as Emcees and the group delivers a tight, polished sound that gets heads nodding and butts shaking.\n\nOn their latest album, Seven League Boots the four man crew eases off of the experimentation from their debut and focuses more on hip-hop that walks the fine line between underground and accessible. By blending the introspective and lyrical tracks like \"Badlands\" with bouncy dance tunes like \"Feeldismusick\" and \"Bigtime\" (Featuring Zion I), Psychokinetics are poised to garner a larger following throughout the hip hop community and beyond.\n\nNot only do Psychokinetics deliver in the studio, but the band is known for an energetic, engaging, and infectious live show as well. They've built a strong fan base from Japan to Denver to Hawaii, and of course the Bay Area, where they've shared the stage with such hip-hop luminaries including KRS-One, Biz Markee, DJ Premier, Black Sheep, Digital Underground, Kool Keith, and more. In addition to winning a John Lennon Songwriting Award, the Psychokinetics placed as finalists in the Musicians Atlas Independent Music Awards for best hip hop artist.\n\nIn the words of Celcius 7, \"This is music for the people, the artists, the dancers, the emcees, the DJs, those who love soulful music, and those who embrace the trials and celebrations of being alive.\" Watch out for these breakthrough artists as they extensively tour in support of Seven League Boots, and keep an eye out for their narrative lounge album due out in 2006." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/asteria> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "In October 2004, Asteria burst onto the national early music scene, winning Early Music America's first Unicorn Prize for Medieval and Renaissance Music with a performance heralded by the New York Times as \"intimate and deeply communicative...meltingly beautiful.\" This engaging duo brings out the passion and emotional impact of late medieval vocal and instrumental music with timeless love songs of wide appeal, transporting their listeners back to the age of chivalry.\n\nEric Redlinger's sweet tenor and skill on the lute are complemented by his expertise in early music, earned through study at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis and extensive archival research into original sources. Following graduation from Middlebury College, Eric spent several years immersing himself in the European musical archives of the Hague, Basel and Marburg. During this time he also did post-graduate studies in composition and musicology at the Frankfurt Conservatory of Music and studied medieval lute with Crawford Young and voice with Richard Levitt at the Schola. He now makes his home in New York, where he has studied with Drew Minter and Gary Ramsey.\n\nSylvia Rhyne brings to the partnership not only her quicksilver soprano but also a strong dramatic connection with the audience, gained from a professional career in musical theater. She has starred internationally as Christine in The Phantom of the Opera and on Broadway as Joanna in Sweeny Todd under the direction of Stephen Sondheim, Harold Prince, and Susan Schulman.\n\nRaised in London and the Pacific Northwest, Sylvia grew up surrounded by classical music, opera and dance. She pursued a passion for early music at Carleton College, guided by Stephen Kelly, taking leading roles in early operas and operettas on her way to a degree in music. She studied also with Wesley Balk at St. Olaf College and recorded with Dennis Russell Davies and the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra. Arriving in New York, Sylvia was invited to sing with the New York City Opera and began ongoing coaching with Marcy Lindheimer.\n\nEric and Sylvia first connected through singing with John Hetland's Renaissance Street Singers, a group that brings a cappella 15th and 16th century music to New York City sidewalks and parks. The pair immediately discovered their mutual interest in earlier repertoire and began meeting regularly to work on late medieval pieces, gradually developing their passionate approach to the music. Asteriaâs performances convey the anguish and ecstasy of the poetry and the rapturous beauty of the interweaving vocal and instrumental lines.\n\nThe result of Asteria's exploration can be heard on their first recording of 15th century chansons, Le Souvenir de Vous me Tue." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/lavra> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "The Hymns Of The All-Night Vigil - the traditional worship singing of Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra by The Kyiv Theological Academy and Seminary choir.\n\nThe worship singing of Kyiv-Pechesk Lavra is a unique and precious heritage of the Orthodox singing culture. The origin of this singing is from the 11th century (1091), in a monastery founded by inok Antony who arrived from Aphona.\n\nLavra's hymns organically synthesize Byzantine tradition and folk-singing culture. Under the influence of south-Slavic songs, Lavras way of singing gained a power and became one of brightest characteristics of the Orthodox world. During solemn festive services, in a state of prayer inspiration, singers unintentionally supplemented and developed this music. That is how the characteristic features of Lavra's singing appeared: the saturation with repeated single words, strongly marked melodism, and mobility of a music substance.\n\nLavra's singing is fixed by sound intonation contour of prayer. It is an exclamation of the heart rushed to God. This is the way used by a heroic monk to come up to God. This is living witness of the century-old tradition.\n\nLavra's hymns are notable for solemn harmony, spiritual touching, prayer inspiration and peculiarity. True beauty, inner might, greatness, power - these were the impressions for all orthodox Christians as well as foreigners. The success can be explained by the understanding of worship singing as spiritual. It is living witness of the orthodox tradition. It is an indicator of the might and greatness of the human spirit. It is distinctive musical chronicle of monastic life, the fire in their hearts, their spiritual depth and wealth." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/drop_trio> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Drop Trio is a melody-driven funk jazz band from Houston, Texas. Their solid musicianship and incredible energy on stage have been drawing kudos across Houston and beyond. In the words of the Houston Press:\n\n\"Houston isn't the greatest city in the world for live jazz, but folks like Drop Trio are out to change that. They don't really fit in with the avant-garde, the martini sippers or the purists; they're more for the young cats who like their jazz a bit funked up with lots of energy. Drop Trio is anchored by a rhythm section tighter than the Texas education budget and a Rhodes keyboard that gets pushed to its limits on every cut.\"\n\nSince their debut in fall 2002, Drop Trio has quickly gathered a loyal Houston following. The trio tours regionally, playing packed rock and jazz clubs, coffee shops and festivals. Feature articles in the Houston Chronicle and nominations in the Houston Press Music Awards, only months after the band's inception, have given the band broad exposure and an exponentially growing fan base.\n\nDrop Trio's music careens between styles, with feet squarely in the New Orleans funk and Acid jazz camps, and nods to such diverse influences as progressive rock, classical composition and electronica. Their sound simultaneously appeals to the jazz sophisticate and the jam band devotee, while their virtuosity earns them fans in unlikely camps. In a recent appearance on Reprogram Radio, a hip hop and DJ showcase on KPFT 90.1, they earned the respect and appreciation of the local DJ scene as one DJ, put it, their music is \"top-notch stuff.\"" .

He focusses on Trance and Techno music.\n\nDuring his university years he met people from the music department and eventually went to work as a sound engineer on Slovakian radio. For many years he has worked in radio, playing pop chart music and refining his technical skills. After spending time abroad, he experienced totally non-commercial style of music, which led to his buying an early sequencer and making his own electronic music.\n\nDJ Markitos's music is normally played around 140-160 BPM and usually has a four-to-the-floor beat. There is a great deal of repetition, provided by arpeggiators and bass lines. Listen for synth effects and layered sounds. The music often builds to a crescendo several times throughout a song. Many tracks devolve into a spacey ambiance or floating piano-type lines at the end.\n\nThe \"Slower Emotions (138 BPM Remixes)\" album is a collection of remixes of songs from DJ Markitos' earlier albums, changed to be at a constant temp of 138 beats per minute. Originally, these songs were remixed for a company releasing the music as exercise-music, sold for Dance, Aerobics and other places where a constant tempo would be helpful. The music worked differently slowed down (most of the songs were originally faster) and it was thought that a release of the remixes might be interesting." .

Together, they blend luxurious electronic soundscapes with acid jazz sounds for a uniquely directional style of music that takes you to another place entirely. The band's self-titled album started off as a college thesis for guitarist DeVito, based on the progression of ambient/electronic music from its origins to the present. When DeVito teamed up with keyboardist Meengs (formerly with the Florida band Sonic Erotica), the project took a new turn and became its very own piece. DeVito's contributions on guitar to LVX Nova hearken back to Edgar Froese's work with Tangerine Dream, and his solo style is reminiscent of early David Gilmour.\n\nIn the summer of 1996, the due pressed 1,500 CDs and began to promote their new record. DeVito, a former BMG employee, used the Internet to promote the release and built an incredible number of underground contacts along the way. When Miramar signed the band in March of 1997 there was already quite an impressive archive of underground press they had garnered on their own.\n\nSince then, the band has done remixes for a number of projects out of Europe and is currently working on a live performance to support the new release.\n\nBand Members:\n  * Bobby DeVito -- guitars, noises, and engineering/production\n  * Mike \"Sonic\" Meengs -- all synths, samples, engineering, production, weird noises, random samples, lush washes, nearly everything but bobby d's parts\n  * Brian Stevenson -- spoken word lyrics and vocals\n  * Curtis H Hayes -- Producer and knob twirler for all guitar production and mixing, and a few odd noises\n  * George Harris -- Panda Productions -- mastering and editing and guitar advice\n  * Mark Prator -- Morrisound Studios -- final mastering and sweetening for the Miramar release\n  * Tom Mehren -- A? from Miramar, and his eyeball is on our album art\n  * Michael Boydstun -- Video Director of the LVX NOVA video" .

Bjorn often has sessions in the night doing mixes as long as five hours or until his computer crashes. Then he sends material over the internet to Johan.\n\nBjorn has his musical roots in the 80s industrial and electronic music, listening to bands such as Skinny Puppy, Ministry and Frontline Assembly. The interest for electronic music made Bjorn want to compose his own music. Bjorn is making trance-remixes for other projects alongside with the project Processor and he is also studying music production at the University.\n\nJohan experiments, mixes and arrange the samples from Bjorn. Johan prefers a straight beat but he is also a fan off breaks and drum and bass. Johan often samples voices from the Television but he also samples recorded voices.\n\nThe voice is not the most important ingredients in a song. Johan and Bjorn use the voice more like an instrument. The voice can be mixed lower and it's not the headline of the music. But they also do remix vocal artists. Before Processor, Johan was very much into ambient music, trance and jungle.\n\nThis particular album contents industrial techno with an edge off breaks.

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/beight> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "After several years of performing around Minneapolis as a solo artist, Brad Senne decided it was time to record a full length album and the end result is File In Rhythm, eleven indie pop gems driven by catchy melodies and quiet ardor.\n\nThe album, which Senne recorded under project name Beight (pronounced \"bait\"), features him on guitar, bass, piano, and vocals. He set it down at Flowers Studio in Minneapolis, where Senne enlisted the engineering/producing expertise of Ed Ackerson (Polara, Kraig Johnson and The Program). Ackerman also contributed some keyboard and bass to a few tracks, while Peter Anderson (The Ocean Blue, Mark Mallman, Polara) sat in on drums.\n\nSenne's melodic fluency and lyrical skills shine through on every single track?from the bright, radio friendly \"File in Rhythm\" and \"Parallels\" to the simple, subdued beauty of \"Without Warning\" and \"In the Middle.\" The second to last tune on the album, \"Invisible City,\" has a big and cinematic yet tender and downcast quality that makes it feel like a lost track from Lost in Translation.

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/amoeba> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Amoeba is the result of a multi-decade collaboration between ambient composer Robert Rich and multi-instrumentalist Rick Davies. The two first met in 1979 after Davies returned from a stretch in England and Spain, and throughout the '80s the two would collaborate on several bands, including Quote Unquote and Urdu. To the union Davies brought a wealth of musical experience, and the ability to play winds, guitars, synth and percussion. He also brought an understanding of electronic music which had been deepened during his time editing magazines Music Technology and Home & Studio Recording.\n\nExperimental musician Robert Rich was one of the first people to work with micro-toned synthesizers, and had performed legendary \"sleep concerts\"?eight hour long concerts of ambient music designed to be listened to by a sleeping audience. He also released several solo albums like Trances/Drones which came out in 1983 and Rainforest, which was issued in 1989. He has worked with Steve Roach, David Tom, Lustmord, Lisa Moskow, Vidna Obmana and Forrest Fang. Indeed, his musical aspirations reached all of the way back into childhood, when he was fascinated by the rhythms and textures of sounds in the world around him (croaking frogs, ventilator shafts, etc.). He built his first synthesizer from a kit at the age of 13.\n\nThe second album produced by Amoeba, Watchful is a masterpiece of collective work by Davies and Rich. Featuring a combination of multi-layered ambient textures and pop instrumentation, the album resembles many works that also existed on the edge of pop, like those by Talk Talk and Dead Can Dance. Receiving many positive reviews, Watchful proved that the artistic marriage of Davies and Rich was fruitful, indeed. Pivot followed in late-2000." .

Upon meeting in a comic book shop, the two future rappers discovered that in addition to their mutual love of comic books, cartoons and animation, they shared a deep feeling for hip-hop. Both had previously been in bands?Keith in high-energy funk outfit Butt'er Crunch, and Jeff in New York hardcore punk group Stisism. Each longed to be on stage again, but it took a little persuading for Keith (a successful comic strip writer and artist) to add performing into his already busy cartooning schedule , yet eventually he gave in.\n\nAdopting the personas of K-Squared and The Noble Def G, Keith and Jeff began writing lyrics in earnest and were eventually joined by bass player Adam Lodge, drummer Adam Lipsky, and guitarist Jeff Ranney. Together, the band has taken its show up and down the West Coast and beyond, opening for Black Eyed Peas, Spearhead, Fishbone, G Love & Special Sauce, Insolence, and De La Soul, as well as headlining many shows of their won.\n\nThe eMPee's self-released debut CD, Twist the Nob sold 20,000 copies and was selected one of 1997's 10 best albums by the San Jose Metro, and one of the Top 100 Indie Releases of the year by PULSE!

I'm getting back to my roots as a guitar player on this album.\"" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/costlow> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "By the time he was twelve Rob Costlow was annoying his piano instructor by adding unwritten endings to songs during rehearsals and recitals.\n\nThis soon brought an end to the lessons that began at age five.\n\n\"I hated, literally hated, taking lessons and especially practicing other people's music,\" admits Rob.\n\nIt was another piano player--platinum selling new age artist George Winston--who fueled this rebellion. After one of Rob's brothers introduced him to Winston's music, Rob realized that his musical future was going to take a different path than the one set by his teachers.\n\n\"It was so different than typical piano music,\" says Costlow. \"It's what drove me to create my own. I said to myself 'I can do this--this is a way that I could actually enjoy piano and benefit from all of these lessons and practicing.' It allowed me to express myself and also provide a great stress relief.\"\n\nWhile Rob has come a long way since those lessons and from his native Indianapolis, his love for creating original compositions is still at the heart of his contemporary solo piano music. His compositions are inspired by love of his family, including his wife Melissa. Travels throughout the United States, Italy, and the Caribbean also provide inspiration.\n\n\"Traveling shows me how much is out there and how there is so much diversity in the world,\" says Rob.\n\nGrowing up in a large family helped Rob become focused and tenacious. As the youngest of six boys, Rob had to get used to seizing every opportunity that came his way. While working on his Masters Degree, Rob unofficially started his own record label based on a fictitious business plan. In 1998, Rob released his first demo album. In 2002, Rob released his first professional solo project, Sophomore Jinx, containing all original music. His ultimate goal is to create music for television and film.\n\n\"Music is a release from the stresses of the world,\" says Costlow. \"I never force myself to write. I do it when it comes to me. I'm taking things a day at a time.\"" .

Formed by Carles Penalver (voices and programming), J+ (composition and programming) and Toni Aran (backing vocals, composition and programming).\n\nAfter their appearance in diverse compilations published in the North American market and the auto-edition of \"Pride\", E.P. of 1998, Self-Delusion has been taken in hand by the producer Frans Beltran (aka-Iberian Spleen and involved also in the production of Spanish bands as diverse as Magnatiz, Freak XXI, Klockwork i Shuga Whuga) to give form to their first album (\"Happiness hurts me\").\n\nThis recording shows the eclecticism of Self-Delusion creating songs on varied electronic structures, which take them from the classic tecnopop to trip-hop, techno-rock or electro. Their sound betrays them as big followers of the music of 80s; their members are indeed fans of very varied bands that go from Depeche Mode to The Smiths, from The Cure to Portishead, from Aviador Dro to Lamb or from Fangoria to Covenant.\n\nSelf-Delusion has been a supporting act for bands such as Wolfsheim and De/Vision, VNV Nation and Apoptygma Berzerk.\n\nWith \"Happiness hurts\", Self-Delusion makes a move to find a place in the electronic national scene as they have obtained it, occasionally, in the international one, where they have managed to edit and to receive prizes as the fourth position in the Clavia MP3 Competition (contest organized by the well known synths manufacturer Clavia -nordlead-) thanks their song \"Christine\", included in \"Happiness hurts me\"." .

To that end, Tom enlisted John Marsden of Little-Big Sound to mix his new album.\n\nTom Paul's original and accessible poetry, along with his keen sense of melodic- oriented songwriting, make his tunes attractive to other artists' interpretations and, through his own devise, stand strongly." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/hoxman> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Hoxman is the one man musical project of Xavier RÃ©gent. A self-taught musician, RÃ©gent studied the piano from childhood but later became deeply fascinated by electronic music (Moroder, Vangelis, Jarre, Kitaro). RÃ©gent made concert piano and voice recordings with singer StÃ©phanie Barrio under the name of scene \"Elkysia,\" but later began concentrating on compositions that were strictly electronic. His first official CD, Argema Moenas, was released in 2001, a period in which RÃ©gent says his music tended to be both experimental, as well as \"cold, violent, and pessimistic.\"\n\nIt would have been impossible then to predict that just a few years later RÃ©gent would release the inspired Synthesis of Five?a warm, transcendant work studded with world music influences and vocals. His work has been compared to that of Enigma, and features upbeat sonic landscapes that evoke another world entirely?one RÃ©gent now describes as \"strange and vibrating.\"" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/evera> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Soprano Emily Van Evera is an uncommonly versatile singer. Her luminous voice blends sense with sensuousness, and can sound at once tender and thrillingly beautiful. Fittingly, Van Evera's inspiration for her first Avie recording is Lady Penelope Rich, a \"heart-stealing goddess\" who was sister to the Earl of Essex, muse to poets and musicians and the devoted mistress to Lord Mountjoy. She also inspired some of the finest music by composers of Elizabethan England.\n\nThe music on My Lady Rich ranges from the Shakespearean \"How should I your true love know\"?from Hamlet, a mad song of Ophelia's, the tragic character to whom Lady Rich's predicament has been likened?to the Spanish \"Vuestros ojos\" (Lady Rich was famously fluent in Spanish); from the spirited \"Hampton Court Masque\" in which Lady Rich took part in 1604 to the sorrowful \"And is it night,\" a nocturnal yearning for a lost lover.\n\nEmily Van Evera has won international acclaim for her numerous ground-breaking and award-winning recordings, particularly of earlier repertoire. Her chart-topping CD of the music of Hildegard von Bingen was singled out by The Gramophone for her characteristic expressivity: \"the sheer power of the words comes across nowhere else as strongly as in Van Evera's performance.\"" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/tilopa> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Tilopa, a one time social scientist who did research on Latin America, has studied quite a wide range of different musical instruments since early childhood (flute, violin, classical guitar, piano, tampoora, dillruba, svarmandal, santoor), but found his real love about 20 years ago when he met with the kyotaku and his flute-master Koku Nishimura in Kumamoto/Japan.\n\nSince that time he has studied the traditional 'honkyoku' zen-music with his master and says that this is a never ending process even though he is playing the same songs over and over again.\n\nAt the same time he has been experimenting with combining the kyotaku with other western and eastern instruments.\n\nHe lives with his wife and a multitude of her paintings in an old farmhouse in the countryside of Bavaria/Germany where he is working as a kyotaku-teacher and maker and also as a t'ai chi teacher.\n\nAbout the Japanese zen-flute:\n\nTilopa is playing the so called kyotaku, also known as Japanese zen-flute or long shakuhachi. This instrument has a pentatonic tuning and has 5 holes like the shakuhachi, but has a much deeper and more mellow sound than the shakuhachi.\n\nIt used to be played more often in the old days of Japan, but was more and more replaced by the shakuhachi during the twentieth century.\n\nIn the same process it changed from an instrument of meditation that was mainly used by a certain buddhist sect of wandering monks (komuso), who played traditional religious pieces (honkyoku) only, to an instrument of more 'worldly' use played with other instruments and in different kinds of music.\n\nTilopa's master, Koku Nishimura, was one of the first to revive the old tradition of kyotaku.\n\nFor a few years now, Tilopa has been giving occasional concerts with Sangeet P. Sieben. Sieben is a gifted guitarist who started out with jazz and rock music years ago, picked up other instruments on his musical life journey and now feels very much at home with ethno-, world- and meditation-music. One of the results of this extraordinary meeting is the CD 'Pictures of Silence', which is a live recording of several improvisational sessions at an art exhibition in Cologne/Germany." .

Much of Ambient Teknology's music, in fact, is based on ideas involving a departure from the old, and a dawn into the new, and Mark continually incorporates new ideas, techologies, and sounds into his music as electronica and techno continue to evolve.\n\nSelf proclaimed as the only electronic artist in Cornwall, Mark has created quite a following for himself there. The official Ambient Teknology website receives thousands of hits from all over the world, and locally Ambient Teknology sells more than 100 CDs a month. Dedicated to creating exceptional dance underground for the local scene and the world at large, Ambient Teknology is on a mission to make music that the old and young alike can touch, feel, breathe, and most importantly?enjoy." .

Our music combines the sacred texts and liturgies of many traditions to reveal the deep knowing of our hearts, that all life is one. We send these songs out as prayers on the breath of our hearts. May they help to bring healing and a sense of wonder at the ways we have named and connected to the Divine.\n\nYa Elah's Vocalists are: Marsha Attie, Cyrise Beatty, Stephanie Bernstein, Alisa Fineman, Nina Perlman, Melita Siberstein and artistic director Bon Singer.\n\nGari Hegedus ('ud, percussion)\n\nGari Hegedus is regarded as an exceptionally accomplished string player. His talent is expressed on the violin, viola, 'ud, sarod, saz, setar, tar, sarangi, and a range of other stringed instruments, including the bowed tambur and mandecello. Gary's musical endeavors began with the study of early European, Celtic, and Breton music. This was the start of a fruitful journey, which led him to intense study and performance of Turkish classical and Mevlevi ceremonial music. He is a core member of the acclaimed group Stellamara, contributing much to its rich and varied sounds.\n\nIn addition to his instrumental proficiency, he is perhaps most recognized for his remarkable compositional skills and his signature, deeply soulful style and beautifully rich improvisations.\n\nShira Kammen (vielle, harp, violin d'amore)\n\nShira Kammen received her degree in music from UC Berkeley and studied vielle with Margaret Tindemans. A member for many years of Ensemble Alcatraz, Project Ars Nova, and Medieval Strings, she has also worked with Sequentia, Hesperion XX, the Boston Camerata, and the King's Noyse. She is also the founder of ClassV Music, an ensemble dedicated to performance on river rafting trips. She has performed and taught in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Israel, Morocco, and Japan, and on the Colorado and Rogue rivers. She had been featured on numerous early music and folk music recordings.\n\nShira happily collaborated with vocalist John Fleagle for fifteen years, and now performs with several new groups: a medieval ensemble, Fortune's Wheel; a new music group, Ephemeros; an eclectic ethnic band, Panacea; and Trouz Bras, a band devoted to the dance music of Celtic Brittany.\n\nTim Rayborn (percussion, psaltery, sehtar, santur)\n\nThough raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, Tim Rayborn lived for nearly seven years in England, where he completed a Ph.D. on the early crusades at the University of Leeds, and worked in the field of early music. He founded and directed Ensemble Florata, whose recordings for London-based ASV/Gaudeamus received international critical acclaim. In addition, he worked with the noted British medieval ensemble Tintagel, and performed with them on BBC broadcasts, Belgian live radio, and in Majorca, as well as their tour of the Pacific Northwest in the U.S.\n\nTim has toured the UK and continental Europe extensively, and worked with traditional musicians in Marrakech and Istanbul, as well as being invited to collaborate with Persian classical musicians in Iran. He plays more than 30 musical instruments. He has recently completed two new solo CDs.\n\nDylan Eliyahu Sills ( flutes)\n\nEliyahu Sills studied jazz performance on the upright bass at the New School ofJazz in NYC in the early 1990's, performing as sideman as well as a band leader in renowned jazz clubs such as The Village Gate and Small's. After leaving New York he fell in love with the flute, and choose to teach himself to play the ancient instrument in order to apply his theories of music education on himself. Eliyahu soon fell under the spell of sufi music of Turkey and the reed flute of the middle east, the Nay, as well as the bamboo flute of India, the Bansuri. He began to studyÃ and perform on these instruments under the guidance of the masters Omar Faruk Tekbilek andÃ Steve Gorn, and is now a dedicated student of the world renowned master of Bansuri, G.S. Sachdev (www.bansuri.net/gssachdev).

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/soulprint> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "How heavy can rock get? Heavier than you think. SoulPrint is redefining rock. No catchy pop here, just the best soulful hard rock that will make you rethink your existence. The apocalypse is now. SoulPrint has been shattering eardrums along the central coast for nearly five years, and once LaBarre graduates @ Cal Poly, they plan to tour the United States.\n\nJason Estes: Jason shows his dedication by driving back and forth from his hometown of Santa Barbara to SLO at least three times a week, just for the band. His passions for singing and expressing himself distinguish him greatly from other vocalists. There's not much else to say about him... and he never really has much to say.\n\nRyan Estes: AKA Rage. If you know him, you know why this is such a fitting nickname. Attempts with every new song to play more chords, and faster. Has a thing for breaking strings and falling over on stage\n\nJohn Reisz: John started playing drums just so the band could form. Seven years later... he adds his own unique flow to the edginess of the thrashing guitars. That is, if he isn't pounding away at the double kick.\n\nRyan LaBarre: The newest member of the band and the only one not born and raised in SLO, Ryan hails from way in up Portland, Oregon. He started out playing guitar, but was drawn to the powerful sounds of the bass two years ago. Less than a week after meeting Rage and Flow at Cal Poly, he found himself playing a show with them at a party in Isla Vista. Luckily, the fans were as drunk as he was, so it didn't matter that he was totally winging it. Now, thank god, he actually knows what he's doing on stage." .

She is America's premier performer of historical harps, and one of the few harpists in the world to play triple harp, medieval harp and contemporary lever harps. Her solo performance for the 2002 World Harp Congress in Geneva affirmed her rank as one of the world's leading harpists. Known for her exceptional artistry, in the last decade she has become a renowned and highly sought after teacher of her masterful and expressive technique. Her solo recital performed at the John F. Kennedy Center featured five historical harps on one program of which the Washington Post said, \"Fulton drew from all of them a serene and delicate sound.... remarkable instruments which Fulton played with total skill and reverent affection.\"\n\nA versatile recording artist, she can be heard on over thirty albums and soundtracks broadly ranging from medieval, baroque, orchestral, and contemporary music to Celtic music and film scores, on major labels including PolyGram, Deutche Harmonia Mundi, Koch International Classics, Nonesuch, Erato, Dorian, Gourd Music, and others. Her first solo album, The Airs of Wales, brought her recognition and acclaim as a \"genuine virtuosa of her instrument.\" A composer as well as performer, her original compositions from her second solo album, The Once & Future Harp, have been featured on National Public Radio.\n\nA leading scholar in the field of historical harps, Dr. Fulton, a Fulbright scholar, is a contributing scholar for the new edition of the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians and has written a chapter for A Performers Guide to Medieval Music (IU Press, 2000).

She earned a BS degree in pedal harp, and an MM and DM in early music/historical harp from the School of Music of Indiana University, Bloomington. During her graduate work she was a devoted student of Thomas Binkley, and served as Associate Instructor of Historical Harp. In 1987 she received a Fulbright award for research and performance in Lisbon, Portugal and while there served as principal harpist for Portugal's finest orchestra, the Orchestre Gulbenkian. She is the founding President of the Historical Harp Society which celebrated it's 20th anniversary in August 2003.\n\nCheryl Ann Fulton is the producer and director, as well as a featured performer along with her Celtic harp group The White Horse Harpers, Jerry O'Sullivan, Shay Black and Liz Carol on the 2001 recording Christmas in an Irish Castle.

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/satamian> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Of Armenian origin, composer, pianist and teacher, Gerard Satamian was born and raised in Beirut, Lebanon. Although his family could hardly support their basic needs, his mother, noticing his early musical inclinations, arranged for him to take private piano lessons.\n\nAt the age of 13 he entered the Beirut National Conservatory of music. At school in Lebanon, Satamian excelled in literature and languages, and for many years immersed himself in the French writers and poets. His early years were filled with the musical traditions of many cultures and styles: Armenian, Arabic, and Western, such as Romanticism and Impressionism.\n\nIn 1977, during the Civil War in Lebanon, Satamian moved to Armenian to continue his piano studies at the Gomitas Conservatory of Music in Yerevan. There he was exposed to the Armenian and Russian composers. He also pursued his love for singing through vocal coaching, finding voice and most natural and expressive instrument. He received his Masters degree in piano, in 1982, but vocal music had found a special place in his heart.\n\nIn 1983, Satamian left Lebanon with his family for Los Angeles. Deeply affected by the tragedies of the war in Lebanon he turned to the Scriptures for answers. For the next 10 years he taught piano while concentrating most of his energy on his spirituality.\n\nAlthough Satamian never studied composition formerly, he always knew he had a gift for writing melodies. Having moved to Vancouver, Canada in 1989 he further developed his composition skills. Chansons sans Paroles (1989) written originally for voice and piano and the Suite Lyrique (1994) are short stories inspired by images of the past and people he knew.\n\nFrancois Houle\n\nFrancois Houle's energetic performances are bridging the gap between the new music and improvisation. He went to McGill University in Montreal where he received his bachelor of music degree and graduated with a Masters degree from the Yale school of music. He also spent two years in residence at the Banff Centre for the arts. His great interest in contemporary music has led him to perform under the direction of Bruce Mather, Mauricio Kagel, Arthur Weisberg, Toru Takemitsa and Yannis Xenakis, among others.\n\nSince moving to Vancouver in 1990, Houle has established itself as a strong new voice on the Canadian creative music scene. Recent performances include all Western Canadian gas festivals, the Ottawa Jazz Festival, the Festival de Music Actuelle de Victoriaville, new music across America, time flies, and Seattle World Jazz Festival. He has also dedicated much of his time composing for his own critically acclaimed group Francois Houle Et Cetera." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/docrossi> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Doc Rossi has studied with Andrea Damiani, Christopher Morrongiello, John Renbourn and Richard Strasser. He has performed as a soloist and with various groups across North America and Europe and has recorded in a variety of contexts, playing Early Music, Hawaiian Slack-key guitar and Celtic, Mexican and American dance music. One of only a handful of players who specialize in the cittern, he is involved in recording projects and performances dedicated to 18th-century composers for plucked string instruments. During the 1980s Doc Rossi was resident at London's acclaimed Islington Folk Club and The Last Straw, a London club that featured less traditionally oriented acoustic music. He has appeared at the Hudson River Revival, the Philadelphia Folk Festival, and the National Folk Festival (UK). Also a scholar, Dr. Rossi has published a modern edition of Thomas Robinson's New Citharen Lessons (1609), plus articles dealing with guitar and cittern history, and with Shakespeare, Brecht, and the Beat Generation.\n\nAndrea Damiani studied the lute with Diana Poulton, Anthony Bailes and Hopkinson Smith. He has performed and recorded extensively across Europe and the USA, both as soloist and continuo player on archlute and theorbo. His passion for research on lute history and literature has led him to discover and record some previously unknown sources: J'ay pris amour, devoted to the heart-shaped manuscript preserved in Pesaro, Biblioteca Oliveriana, is the main early lute source before Ottaviano Petrucci's prints; and Folias, containing music from 17th-century central Italian sources for archlute, theorbo and guitar, among them a recently found manuscript containing unknown guitar pieces by Giovanni Paolo Foscrini. He has also recorded a CD dedicated to Il Fronimo of Vincenzo Galilei. Mr. Damiani has been invited to teach at several international early music courses, such as those held in Chiusi della Verna, Erice, Lanciano, and by the Cini Foundation of Venice. He regularly teaches at the International Summer Course held in Urbino. He is Lute Instructor at the Conservatorio S. Cecilia in Rome, and the author of Method for Renaissance Lute, published by Ut- Orpheus." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/stargarden> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "It all started with a shoebox and rubber bands....\n\nBorn the son of an electronics industry father, Bobby DeVito was exposed to the wonders of computers and electronics at an early age. His parents noticed a certain musical bent when they discovered the young child placing rubber bands on a shoebox in tonal order. Soon the budding musician received a guitar for his birthday.\n\nDuring the early days of his youth, Bobby often accompanied his father to work, marveling at the rooms full of mainframe computers at Control Data. He and his father were electronics hobbyists as well, building a digitally controlled television with remote control in 1976. At this time, Bobby got his hands on his first synthesizer - an Arp Axxe. Running this basic monosynth through an MXR delay and flanger opened new worlds of sonic discovery. Nevertheless, the guitar proved the be his main instrument for many years, with Bobby touring the USA with new wave pioneers The X-Statics. DeVito was able to fulfill his synthesizer jones during these years by toying with lead vocalist/keyboardist Jon Allmightey's analog synths during rehearsals and soundchecks. After seven years of constant touring and performance, the band split up and Bobby headed to South Florida for an unknown musical future.\n\nGathering together a drum machine, 4 track recorded, and some signal processing gear, Bobby recorded his first album \"Guitar Salad\" during this era. This album was more successful than anything he had done previously, being featured on mainstream radio stations all over Florida and garnering a fair amount of press attention. This project set Bobby upon the solo artist path that he has pursued ever since. It was also during this time that academia beckoned, and DeVito managed to get into the prestigious IDS program at St. Petersburg Junior College. After graduating from SPJC, he set his sights on the progressive honors university New College in Sarasota Florida. After making it through the gauntlet of admissions tests and interviews, DeVito was accepted and began to work intensely with Professor Steven Miles, the director of the music program for the college. Miles was a huge influence on the budding electronic music composer, exposing Bobby to a world of sounds, textures, sociological theory, and music history. It was also beneficial that New College had just built an electronic music studio the year DeVito started his studies, as well as hiring an electronic music professor from the Eastman School of Music, Robert Constable. The electronic odyssey had begun. At New College Bobby was exposed to the music and compositional thoughts of composers such as John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Milton Babbitt, and Iannis Xenakis, as well as philosophers of music such as Walter Benjamin, Simon Frith, and Theodor Adorno. This learning experience helped DeVito to develop his compositional skills and theories, as well as gather an appreciation of electronic music history and conceptual framework.\n\nDuring these halcyon college days, DeVito managed to secure a job working for BMG Distribution as their College Marketing Rep, a position he held for three years that allowed him to get \"real-world\" experience in the music industry. At New College, each student must write a Master's Thesis in order to graduate, and Bobby decided on an ambitious project -- to combine his written thesis with a full length album of ambient music. Starting with Erik Satie, and ending up with modern day composers such as Aphex Twin, DeVito's thesis covers the dawn and progression of ambient music, the ways ambient music is distinguished from Muzak, and the sociological implications of ambient music listener reception by touching on the theories of philosopher Theodor Adorno. DeVito's thesis lives on in Hyperreal's \"Epsilon Ambient Music Archive\".\n\nThe CD portion of his thesis is entitled LVX Nova. This project was a collaboration between DeVito and noted electronic composer Mike Meengs. The thesis project was a success, and DeVito graduated from New College in 1996.\n\nAfter graduation, DeVito set out to get the project released commercially. After releasing the album independently and garnering over 60 pages of press worldwide, three labels presented offers to release the album: R? Records in Belgium, Subharmonic Records in NYC, and MIRAMAR Records in Seattle. After entertaining all the offers, DeVito decided to sign with MIRAMAR, home to one of his biggest influences Tangerine Dream, and also a part of the BMG Distribution family. LVX Nova received tons of press, critical accolades, and made it to several \"top ten releases\" lists. In addition, the CD won several awards, including the 1999 \"JAMMY\" award in Florida for best electronic act.\n\nHowever, with the instability of MIRAMAR after motion picture company UNAPIX bought out the label in 1999, DeVito was again without a label. After doing some international touring with Atlantic/Code Blue recording artist Sherman Robertson (as bandleader and second guitarist) DeVito once again plunged into the electronic abyss. Stargarden was born at this time. The name stargarden is directly influenced by the underwater life of starfish, who can form huge colonies on the sea floors in a communal form -- sadly, unlike their human counterparts.\n\nHoled up in a loft in Hyde Park Tampa, and later Miami Florida, DeVito creates music entirely for the sake of the process and the enjoyment of his fans. Relying on timbre, repetition, and space, the music of stargarden ranges from drifting ambient space music to beat driven electronica. Bobby cites other artists such as Tangerine Dream, Aphex Twin, Brian Eno, Global Communication, Peter Namlook and FAX artists, John Cage as influences on his particular brand of ambient music. After discovering the then-fledgling MP3.com from his friend. sometime musical partner, and influence Mike Meengs, DeVito placed the first stargarden album on MP3.com, and received thousands and thousand of downloads, as well as quite a few CD sales.\n\nNow, in order to bring electronic music distribution to a new level, DeVito has signed stargarden with Magnatune, believing in their new model of music distribution and intellectual property management. And with new music being released only here on Magnatune, the future of stargarden ambient music is secure.\n\nIf you like this music, please consider buying a CD or two to help the process continue. The quest for ambient beauty continues....." .

His meditative compositions are a seamless, soothing blend of harmonic and acoustic channels, played on an ever-changing lineup of instruments including didgeridoo, djembe, and talking drum, as well as the gopichand, udu, and hulusi?a Chinese bamboo woodwind dating back to the time of Buddha.\n\nChristopher began crafting his distinctive form of playing over ten years ago in Portland, Oregon, where he took an African drumming class for fun and discovered he not only enjoyed it, but had a talent for it as well. Gradually over the years, he began adding instruments such as the djembe (African hand drum) and didgeridoo to his repertoire, first playing them individually, and eventually mastering the art of simultaneous playing. These days, he's been known to play up to five or six instruments at a time during live performances?each one from a from different musical tradition or region of the world. The resulting sound is timeless and universal, yet also deeply warm and resonant, and has been described the ideal accompaniment to meditation, relaxation, yoga, and massage, as well as just listening.\n\nChristopher's most recent album, Spheres, combines 22 different instruments from around the world for a mesmerizing blend of acoustic drone, rhythm, and melody. It also includes a few choice selections from Christopher's popular street show, which he has performed in more than 14 countries.\n\nSays Christopher, \"When I see a person stop in the middle of a bustling street in the midst of their busy day, and close their eyes and stop everything for even a few seconds, then I feel I am creating something of real value, and I feel satisfied.\"\n" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/lizzi> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "There's both longing and loneliness in Lizzi's dark, sensual voice. Love and chill -- like the icy winter winds sweeping across her native island of Gotland in Sweden. \"To be in love is a kind of isolation,\" she says. \"It's not all happiness and joy: there's a lot of pain and emptiness too. But longing is also an incredible feeling, much under-valued today.\"\n\nGrowing up in a poor music-loving family of six children, Lizzi knows all about longing. \"I was lucky,\" Lizzi says. \"I was on friendly terms with the preacher. He let me use the village church to sing whenever I wanted.\" The mental image of a little girl singing her heart out -- alone in a vast, empty church in the dark of night -- still resonates through one's mind when listening to Lizzi's music today.\n\nLizzi started singing professionally in the synth band Houses & Gardens. \"One of the band members heard me singing in the shower and thought I should have a go. Some of the other guys in the band thought I was too cheerful. I was prohibited to laugh during performances.\" She says synth-rock really wasn't her style but she did it because she loved to sing. \"And I've always been a chameleon. It's taken me a long time to find my own voice.\"\n\nIn 1994, she released her first solo album, \"Lizzie,\" for which she wrote most of the songs. \"But that wasn't really me either, even though I believed so at the time. It didn't take very long to find out...\"\n\nLater, she spent two years singing with the Swedish avant-garde group, The Flesh Quartet. Working in The Flesh Quartet brought her together with producer Jacob Hellner. After having turned down one record company who wanted to morph her into a Swedish Kylie Minogue(!), Lizzi and Jacob decided to make her new album on their own. \"I can't sell my soul. If I did I'd really be poor forever. I'd rather work petty day jobs as long as I can sing. Besides, I can only sing about things I've experienced - that's when it gets good.\"\n\nThe new album, \"Love and you and I,\" is about uniting opposites -- staying and walking away, sadness and happiness -- and musically uniting the coldness of loops and computers with the warmth of real instruments. \"The album is the story of a love affair -- from the beginning, through all the conflicting emotions to the not necessarily bitter end... Simplicity is the keyword, both musically and lyrically,\" Lizzi says.\n\nThough she left Gotland long ago, the magic island is still in her blood. \"When I sing my lyrics, it's as if I'm back there somehow. It's the same feeling I had when I lived there as a child -- the sunlight flooding sideways at dusk, like a flash of lightning racing through the landscape.\" Somehow, that feeling flows through her songs, too.\n\nUlf Ivarsson plays bass on Lizzi's \"Love and you and I,\" and also has a solo project on Magnatune under the name \"Beat Under Control.\"" .

The Depths of a Year was written from the age of 18 to 19 while I first attended the University of Kansas. Much of the album came from a need to cope with a failed relationship. I wrote the album and called Kate who I barely knew. I did know she could play and she gladly joined on. I dropped out of school to play piano and organ with a rock and roll band called the gadjits ( now the architects) and a band called the belles. I toured for two and a half years, playing over 300 shows in all of north america and the UK.\n\nBeing burnt out by the road and rough lifestyle, I have happily returned to school to study visual arts and focus on my composing, drawing from the likes of Radiohead, Interpol, and many others.

The L.A. Times has said: \"St. John brings to the stage personal charisma, an unflagging musical imagination and genuine passion. Her two albums to date are bona-fide classics of the violin discography.\"\n\nIn January 2002, Lara released her third CD on her own label. Bach: The Concerto Album and has received enthusiastic reviews. Gramophone Magazine placed the disc in its strongly recommended section, and wrote \"It is difficult to argue with such a technically dazzling and unfailingly musical interpretation.\"\n\nDuring 1999/2000 highlights included engagements with the National Arts Centre Orchestra, Seattle Symphony, Vancouver Symphony, Buffalo Philharmonic, Shanghai Broadcasting Symphony, and Edmonton Symphony, while the 2000/01 season brought her debuts with the New Jersey Symphony under Hugh Wolff, the Tokyo Symphony (Paavo Jarvi), Hong Kong Philharmonic, Honolulu Symphony, and Calgary Philharmonic, among others. During last season she debuted with the Cincinnati Symphony, Prague Philharmonia, Sao Paulo Symphony, Opera de Marseille and performs numerous other concerto appareances in Canada and the US, as well as recitals at Ravinia, the Miller Theater in New York, in Montreal, Quebec City, and throughout China. Season 2002/03 continues the array of appearances on the recital stage and as soloist with orchestra, among them the symphonies of Portland, Delaware, Knoxville, the Florida Orchestra, and Northwest Sinfonietta. In addition she will undertake a nation-wide recital tour under the auspices of Community Cocerts. Other future engagements include debuts at Tanglewood with the Boston Pops under Keith Lockhart and performances with the Vancouver Symphony, among others.\n\nShe has been victorious in several competitions and in 1997 won the use of the 1702 Lyall Stradivarius for two years from the Canada Council for the Arts and an anonymous donor. Upon hearing her audition, the panel of judges exclaimed, \"Today we have heard one of the great violinists of our time! Inspirational.\" Currently, she performs on the 1779 \"Salabue\" Guadagnini thanks to an anonymous donor and Heinl & Co., Toronto.\n\nLara began playing the violin when she was 2 years old. She first soloed with orchestra at age 5, and made her European debut with the Gulbenkian Orchestra (Lisbon) five years later. She toured Spain, France, Portugal and Hungary at ages 12 and 13, entered the Curtis Institute at 14, and spent her first summer at Marlboro three years later.\n\nUpon her graduation from Curtis, at age 17, Lara took off for Moscow to find out if there was really more to life than just music --- there was. At this time, most teachers at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory (including hers) were indefinitely extending their journeys west, and being without a teacher for the first time gave her the opportunity to travel extensively throughout the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. She also spent two years in England at the Guildhall school, holds a certificate from the Mannes College in New York City, and an Artist's Diploma from the New England Conservatory in Boston. Her teachers over the years have included Linda Cerone, David Takeno, Arnold Steinhardt, Felix Galimir and Joey Corpus.\n\nLara is a great fan of J.R.R. Tolkien, reptiles, and the American Museum of Natural History. She resides in New York City." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/briddes_roune> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "The name Briddes Roune (BREE-dess RONE) is Middle English for bird song/conversation/speech and is a reference to the fact that two of the three of us are named Robin. I formed Briddes Roune specifically to record early medieval English songs, a repertoire I have been singing for several years. As anyone who's read Chaucer aloud knows, Middle English has a delightfully musical lilt, making it a fun language to sing, and the English fondness for thirds and sixths gives the music a sweetness that is unusual for that time.\n\nThis recording includes the songs of St. Godric, who claimed that all of his songs came to him in visions. For example, during a vision in which he saw Mary Magdalene and the Virgin Mary, the Virgin taught him \"Sainte Marie viergene,\" saying that if he found himself in pain or tired or succumbing to temptation, he should sing this song and she would come quickly to his aid. Godric died in 1170, making these songs the earliest songs in English with extant melodies. More on St. Godric can be found in the liner notes.\n\nI am particularly drawn to the songs without fixed rhythms. The rhythms of songs such as \"Stond wel, moder, under roode\" and \"Ar ne kuth, ich sorghe non\" are driven by the speaking rhythms of the words and by musical intuition. I like the improvised quality of these songs, and I enjoy the extra opportunity to express the text.\n\nPerforming medieval music involves some challenges not faced by those interested in later music. Instrumental accompaniments were almost never written down, and even the choice of instruments used was quite free. What you hear on this recording is very much our own arrangement. Our instrumental parts arise from a combination of planning and improvisation. Instrumental countermelodies are generally written out in advance by either Kathryn or myself. Drone parts are generally worked out in rehearsal. The process goes something like this:\n\nKathryn: How about this?\nRobin S.: ...mmm...no...maybe an A?...no...a D?...no....\nKathryn: What about this?\nRobin S: Yeah, that's best.\nKathryn: That's what I played originally.\n\nAll instrumental preludes and interludes are improvised.\n\nIn addition to the challenge of writing our own instrumental parts, very few English songs have survived with their melodies, although we have many lyrics. For the surviving melodies, I have used E.J. Dobson and F. Ll. Harrison's book, Medieval English Songs. For others (e.g. Lenten is come, Lutel wot hit any mon), I have set lyrics in the style of that time and place. I typically start by choosing a mode, which defines what notes are in the scale and which are most important, and then I start playing with the words, improvising tunes. When I get a fragment that I like, I write it down, and gradually the piece begins to take shape." .

I would much rather my listeners draw their own conclusions on that one.\"\n\nFor Etherfysh, 2005 saw collaborations with with Dutch EM artist Gert Emmens, as well as the release of Stasis, a work of hypnotic melodies wrapped around subtle, silvery beats.\n\nEtherfysh's other releases include Musick in the Quay of Sea, A Box of Fysh, and Pandora's Box." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/mijo> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Mijo (AKA Michel Jordan) began his musical adventures on flute and piano at the tender age of 8. By age 11 he had branched out into woodwinds, playing alto sax in the school orchestra until the fateful day in 1977 when his family moved to Germany and he was forced to leave the saxophone behind.\n\nLuckily, this did not spell the end of his career - upon arriving in Germany, he promptly put his talents to good use on a Gibson western guitar, expanding his repertoire with lessons and collaborations with Thomas Reuther, who went on to become a noted classical guitarist in his own right.\n\nThe two went on to eventually form the Turkish/Oriental fusion band 'Grup Fakir', with several other musicians, and received critical acclaim and an offer to tour Turkey in the mid-1990's. Unfortunately the band dissolved shortly after recording their first demo cd, but Thomas and Michel continued their forays, delving into musical motifs that firmly straddled Greek and Turkish origins.\n\nIn 1995 Michel met new cohorts, Christian Wolff and Michael Fey, who he went on to produce and perform live soundscapes and themes to Fachhochschule - Frankfurt theatres production of Shakespeares' 'Midsummer Nights Dream' and 'Macbeth'. Again, his efforts met with resounding success, both personally and publicly.\n\nMichel and Christian went on to form the experimental acoustic/electro-fusion/jazz/techno/blues-rock band 'Ultraschall', playing on a weekly basis with guest artists from around the world, including Christian Schmidhofer of Embryo.\n\nIn 1999, Jordan and Fey teamed up, under the Sensor II moniker, to produce some new tracks with a more electronic edge, cuts of which rose to the top of the charts on Garageband.com and were included on the Garageband 'Best of Electronica' compilation CD. It was through Garageband that Artemis connected with Jordan to eventually produce the track 'Hypno' on Artemis' latest release 'Gravity'.\n\n'Fata Morgana' is Jordan's latest effort, a sensual trip that beats a path across time and genre, melding the past, present and future sounds of world music." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/duo_de_bois> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Stephen Schultz, called \"among the most flawless artists on the baroque flute\" by the San Jose Mercury News, and \"flute extraordinaire\" by the New Jersey Star-Ledger, is solo and co-Principal flutist with the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra and performs with other leading early music groups such as Musica Angelica of Los Angeles, Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra, Chatham Baroque, and American Bach Soloists. Concert tours have taken him throughout Europe and North America with featured appearances at the Mostly Mozart Festival in New York, the Musikverein in Vienna, Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, Carnegie Hall, Royal Albert Hall in London, Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, Gottingen International Handel Festival, Library of Congress in Washington D.C., Tage Alter Musik Festival, Regensburg, Berkeley Early Music Festival, Monadnock Music, J. Paul Getty Museum Summer Series, San Luis Obispo Mozart Festival, San Jose Chamber Music Society, and the Nakamichi Early Music Festival.\n\nA graduate of the Royal Conservatory of Music in Holland, Schultz also holds several degrees from the California Institute of the Arts and the California State University of San Francisco. Currently he is an Associate Teaching Professor in Music History and Flute at Carnegie Mellon University and director of the Carnegie Mellon Baroque Orchestra. Schultz's engaging teaching style has left its mark at California State University at Long Beach and Sacramento, the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, Holy Names College, the University of Southern California, and the University of California at Davis and Los Angeles. Mr. Schultz is also a featured faculty member of the Jeanne Baxtresser International Flute Master Class at Carnegie Mellon University and at the International Baroque Institute at Longy School of Music.\n\nIn 1986, Mr. Schultz founded the original instrument ensemble, American Baroque. This unique group brings together some of America's most accomplished and exciting baroque instrumentalists, with the purpose of defining a new, modern genre for historical instruments. The group's adventurous programs combine 18th-century music with new works, composed for the group through collaborations and commissions from American composers. Collaborations with such artists and composers as Rudy Rucker, Jonathan Berger, Carl Stone, and the Common Sense Composers Collective yielded an unprecented number of commissioned works written specifically for the group's instruments. The ensemble remains the only U.S. chamber ensemble committed to performing both new music and 18th-century works on historical instruments, while continuing to explore the issues raised by both genres, old and new.\n\nAs solo, chamber, and orchestral player, Schultz appears on nearly fifty recordings for such labels as Dorian, Naxos, Harmonia Mundi USA, New Albion, Amon Ra, and Koch International Classics. Schultz has produced and edited forty CDs for his colleagues and has also performed and recorded with world music groups such as D'CuCKOO and Haunted By Waters, using his electronically processed Baroque flute to develop alternative sounds that are unique to his instrument. In 2006, the Pittsburgh composer Nancy Galbraith wrote Traverso Mistico for Mr. Schultz. It is scored for electric Baroque flute, solo cello, and chamber orchestra and was given its world premiere at Carnegie Mellon University in April 2006.\n\nElizabeth Blumenstock is one of the country's leading baroque violinists. A frequent soloist, concertmaster, and leader with Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra, Los Angeles-based Musica Angelica, American Bach Soloists, Chicago Opera Theater, and the Italian ensemble, Il Complesso Barocco, she is also a member of several of California's finest period instrument chamber ensembles, including Musica Pacifica, the Arcadian Academy, American Baroque, Trio Galanterie, and Trio Galatea. Ms. Blumenstock is Resident Artistic Director of Musica Angelica's chamber music series. With over 90 recordings to her credit, she has recorded for Dorian, harmonia mundi, Virgin Classics, BMG, Reference Recordings, Koch International, Sony, and New Albion.\n\nMs. Blumenstock has appeared with period orchestras and chamber ensembles throughout the United States and abroad, and has performed at the Boston and Berkeley Early Music Festivals, the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival, Los Angeles Opera, the Carmel Bach Festival, and the San Luis Obispo Mozart Festival, among others. She is instructor of baroque violin at the University of Southern California and teaches regularly at the International Baroque Institute at Longy in Cambridge, MA. Ms. Blumenstock is also organist/choir director at Holy Trinity Episcopal Church in Richmond, CA, and is an avid Scrabble and pinball player." .

In an age when slickly packaged pop stars are force-fed to the public with maximum bombast, Wade is an artist whose humble approach is a refreshing change.\n\nElectronic yet emotional, digital yet honest and human, his music is an invitation to lose oneself in reverie. \"I fell in love with music and became that quintessential bedroom recluse listening to tapes and LPs over and over again,\" Wade explains. \"I wanted to make music for people like me, so I've tried to create things that are open ended and allow people to think for themselves and daydream to.\"\n\nA native of Austin, Texas, Wade now resides in San Francisco where he collaborates with a community of like-minded musicians such as virtuoso guitarist and key player Erik Cline, and guitarist Paul Martin. Together the three perform under the name Echolalia.\n\nWade is a studio production whiz and multi-instrumentalist who plays guitar, keys, bass, and a wide array of electronic instruments. His long list of influences range from Spiritualized to The Flaming Lips, and underground artists such as Fourtet, Bedhead, and Marumari.\n\nHis debut CD is being embraced by college radio, the underground press, and fans who long for music with a subtlety and depth often lacking in both mainstream and indie music.\n\nAlthough the CD's title hints at a political message or philosophical statement, Wade is characteristically understated on the subject. \"I'm not really sure what the world is all about, but I'm willing to accept that and just try to be good to folks and create music that they might like.\"\n\nWhether it is something spiritual, political, or simply human emotion you seek, the best way to learn the truth about Wade Williamson is to put on his CD, close your eyes, and enjoy." .

His uncanny ear for melody, hooks, and arrangement is paralleled only by his captivating voice which seems to carry the weight of a thousand break-ups, but somehow manages to soar effortlessly to a place where joy, goose bumps, and repeated listens are unavoidable. Built on beefy rhythms, unforgettable riffs and clever lyrics that can quickly go from touching to venomous, Arthur's songs are models of contemporary pop song craft.\n\nAfter stints in the Houston based bands, The Jeepneys and Lavendula, Arthur decided to set out on his own and released a self-titled EP in 2001 to much critical acclaim as well as some interest from various major labels. With a solid backing band and a commitment to play live as often as possible, the end of the year brought with it a nomination in the Houston Press Music Awards \"Best New Act\" category and a management deal with Los Angeles based Kio Novina Management (Tenacious D, Sugarcult, Actual Tigers).\n\nFollowing the release of another critically acclaimed EP, can you still look adorable in 2002, Arthur and good friend, former Houston Rocket, Matt Maloney began talking about forming a record label for the purposes of releasing a full-length CD. Two years, a few SXSW showcases, maybe the most nominations for a single artist in the Houston Press Music Awards (for the past three years) and several drunken conversations about the state of the music industry later, Matt and Arthur have finally made good on their plans.\n\nI'll Be Here Awake is Arthur Yoria's debut full-length, self-released album. A stunning achievement, this album shows the Houston based, Chicago native at the apex of his talents. From beginning to end, this 37 and-a-half minute concept pop/rock masterpiece delivers one swift kick after another while leaving imprints, not soon erased of it's well-crafted melodies, undeniable hooks and raw emotions. One of those rare releases that not only wins over the reluctant music snob, but gets the reluctant music snob's grandmother humming; I'll Be Here Awake is that CD that becomes more reliable than your best friend.\n\n\"I just wanted to make a very simple and to the point, rock record about this very nasty and egotistical fictional character that I vicariously live through from time to time,\" Arthur says, \"I went easy on the overdubs after the basic tracks were on tape in order to avoid making the big and lush, singer-songwriter-type record that I was supposed to make and unlike a lot of past studio experiences, I ended up having the time of my life in there. I just hope that the playful atmosphere as well as the contrast between that atmosphere and the sometimes not-so-pleasant subject matter comes through when people listen to this thing.\"\n\nIan Varley plays in Arthur Yoria's live band and is the organist in Drop Trio, a groove-oriented organ-based funk jazz trio." .

As his tastes broadened, however, he began bringing in folk influences such as Nick Drake and Damien Rice, and creating the hypnotic folk-rock for which he is known today. It's this melodic yet mesmerizing sound that Sanders uses to explore issues of spirituality. Although his music expresses a deep yearning for enlightenment, it's Sanders' willingness to examine the eerie, lonely side of this quest that makes his music so powerful.\n\nThough these dark, even spooky influences are definitely felt throughout his work, Sanders' music also contains a deep vein of introspection that keep it from being menacing. One reviewer described the first Mountain Mirrors album, Lunar Ecstasy, as a work \"fit for poets, travelers and seekers,\" while another called it \"the perfect chill-out album with brief touches of Delerium, Alice in Chains, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Portishead and The Tea Party.\" In February 2004, Lunar Ecstasy was named album of the month by both IndieSoundz and StonedGods, and \"Afterlife\" was chosen by Indie Music Beat Magazine for their annual 101 Great New Music Tracks CD.\n\nThe eponymous Mountain Mirrors album is Sanders' second full length album, and shows a deepening mastery of his intense, supernatural sound. Guest musicians include Elad Fish on drums and piano, Claire Fitch on cello, Oren Selas on keyboards, and Guy Bar-Tor on bass. \"They're phenomenal, absolutely sent from heaven,\" says Sanders.\n\nSays The Sound Monitor of Mountain Mirrors, \"From atmospheric sounds to Massive Attack style trip-hop with your more standard acoustic guitar & soft singing tracks. The music takes you on numerous twists and turns throughout dark and beautiful landscapes from your dreams and nightmares.\"" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/falik> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "All that matters in the Falik experience is where the music takes you, and this music is definitely mobile. Falik infuses middle-eastern, Greek, Celtic, and Baltic folk elements with electronica; it is at once exotic and familiar. The songs have a raw, earthy quality, but are ebullient, exciting, and entirely engaging to the listener, with melodies that aim straight for your heart.\n\nFalik is Charlie Pecot, who has traveled an interesting and eclectic path. This music is definitely a \"snapshot\" that illustrates where he has been.\n\nFor Charlie - as it is for many people - music is a consolation, a stimulus that helps one to make peace with troubled thoughts. It vitalizes the spirit, recharges the will, and inspires the body and soul to movement and action. Charlie has always felt his life was somewhat \"charmed\" by music; that he feels elevated when he plays, more in tune with his surroundings like as if a cloud has lifted allowing the illumination of his true self. Sometimes his true self can be quite amusing.\n\nProfessionally, Charlie has always done what felt right and remains true to his own personal philosophies. Sometimes, this means eschewing possible commercial success in favor of artistic expression, but his goal is to bring to the forefront his brand of \"popular\" thematic art.\n\nCharlie has always been a fan of \"pop\" music, being influenced as a child by '60s blues, soul and rock groups that made their way into popular culture, and then later by English art/rock groups: Jumi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Sweat, Blood and Tears, Sly and the Family Stone, Led Zeppelin, Beatles, Rolling Stones, Kinks, The Who, Eric Clapton, Supertramp, Yes, David Bowie, Foghat, Genesis, Queen.\n\nIf anything, \"Falik\" is the result of Charlie's demented view of what he thinks is \"world fusion pop\". This is his attempt at combining everything he knows and appreciates about the music he loves and putting into a format that he feels people are already familiar with. Charlie is a big fan of dance music, and not just because he loves to dance. He loves the way that music can make you feel like dancing. This is the essence of what he tries to capture. He wants to invoke in the listener the desire to sway, shake, boogie, and groove - to delight in the joy of movement and self-expression. It may be interesting to note at this point that children have always responded favorably to Falik; they \"get\" him." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/kperl> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Katherine Roberts Perl began her harpsichord studies at the age of 14 and went on to study music at Los Angeles City College, Immaculate Heart College, and the San Francisco Conservatory of Music where she studied intensively with Laurette Goldberg and received her Master's Degree harpsichord performance. Since that time Perl has developed both a unique teaching and playing style for which she has become well known?one that celebrates the dynamic and expressive aspects of the harpsichord and is influenced by the American idioms of blues and jazz.\n\nWhile conventional ideas of the harpsichord hold that it does not allow for variation in volume, Perl's powerful playing overturns this perception, and mines the expressive capacity of the instrument. Her innovative approach has been termed \"sound sculpture.\"\n\nMs. Perl's first recording, Pieces de Clavecin, Music of Louis Couperin was nominated for Best Baroque Recording of French music in 1993, in Paris. The second recording, Music of Jacques Duphly, was released in 1998 on the Dorian label and most recently Perl's independent recording of four of Bach's French Suites has been made available on Magnatune. Bach's classic composition for harpsichord, The Well-Tempered Clavier, has now become the center of Perl's artistic attention and future recordings and releases are in the works.\n\nIn addition to her performing, teaching, and recording activities, Katherine Roberts Perl is an esteemed harpsichord technician, serving the Bay Area. She and her husband Mark produce a concert series/salon in their home in San Francisco called Chattanooga Chamber Music, which consists of four live music performances every fall and spring.\n\n\"I consider myself extremely fortunate that my life thus far has been contemporary with many great masters,\" says Perl, \"who have shown the way for practitioners of early music performance in my own generation and the next: musicians such as Gustav Leonhardt, the Kuijken brothers and Hopkinson Smith, to name a few.\" She adds, \"My mission in life is to play the music of Bach, Couperin and others on the harpsichord with clarity and grace, and to teach others what it takes to do so. Meaningful expression is an elusive thing, and so wondrous when it is achieved.\"\n\nAdditional Praise for Katherine Roberts Perl:\n\n\"The key to Roberts' success is her fluent but precise rhythmic sense. She has a way of springing the rhythm, drawing out the line, waiting until the last possible moment before attacking a note without damaging the onward flow in the slightest. Strength and delicacy, nuance and bite seemed available in abundance...a fluent but precise rhythmic sense.\" ?Charles Shere, Oakland Tribune\n\n\"She genuinely captured the essence of accurate, sensitive and stylistic French keyboard playing...the audience was enraptured...passion and fire.\" ?Ruta Bloomfield, Iowa city\n" .

He is also very good singer with very peculiar voice. His solo at\" O THEOTOKOS AND VIRGIN REJOYS\" is amazing and I'm sure this chant will melt your hart.\n\nDuring the centuries the specific style of singing was formed in Monastery of Kiev-Pechersk Lavra (don't mix up with Old Kiev Chants). The origin of Kiev-Pechersk Lavra singing is in XI century when inok Anthony, arrived from Aphona, founded the Kiev-Pechersk Monastery. Lavra's hymns organically synthesize Byzantine tradition and folk-singing culture of old Rus. Under the influence of south-Slavic tunes Larva's way of singing gained a power and became one of bright characteristics of Ancient Rus. There are only two Kiev-Pechersk chants on this CD (\"From My Youth\" and \"God With Us\") because there is another CD specially dedicated to traditional worship singing of Kiev-Pechersk Lavra. You can listen and buy this CD at www.cdbaby.com/anthology\n\nIn 1784, the Italian conductor and composer J.Sarti (1729-1802) visited Russia. He was so enraptured by Orthodox Church singing that he left Italy for Russia and till the end of his days he lived and worked there. He wrote many beautiful chants for Russian Church and one of this chant is represented on this CD (\" O THEOTOKOS AND VIRGIN)" .

She moved to Holland to study with the cellist Anner Bijlsma and in 1987 earned a soloist's diploma at the Royal Conservatory in The Hague. Inspired by Mr. Bijlsma, Tomkins became interested in the performance of music on original instruments. As a member of the Trio d'Amsterdam (with clarinetist Eric Hoeprich and fortepianist Stanley Hoogland), she made a New York debut at the Frick Collection, which was recorded for National Public Radio and also appeared in Lincoln Center's \"Great Performers\" series in 1996.

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/beatundercontrol> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Beat under control--a new project led by the Swedish bassplayer Ulf \"Rockis\" Ivarsson introduces a unique mix of dub, jazz, funk, electronica, roots, rock and global beats.\n\nOn the album \"The Introduction\" Ulf Ivarsson (who has previously toured and recorded with artists such as Thomas Dileva, Sky High and Hedningarna) teams up with Goran Kajfes on trumpet, celloplayer Raymond King, guitarist George Nakas and Per Wiberg on keyboards. These are some of the most interesting players on the contemporary Swedish music scene.\n\nThe opening track \"Blue Lights\" shows some of the many varied influences that forms the basis of \"Beat under control\". Goran Kajfes plays the majestic theme and improvise together with Per Wiberg over Ulf Ivarssons basslines, that leads us through a musical landscape which incorporates sounds and beats associated with both Miles Davis (Bitches Brew era) and eastern music.\n\nKajfes appears again on the next track \"Sacred\" a pulsating piece of ambient electronica. The track also features Raymond Kings electrically fuelled cello harmonies.\n\n\"This is beat under control\"--the third track--is built around a hard driving beat in the Roni Size school of drum-n-bass. The melody that leaps with the first basstheme is played on a Augustus Pablo-inspired melody and shows Ulf Ivarssons influences from reggae music.\n\nThe next title \"Direction Dub\" goes more in the dub direction. The production of this modern dub track feature a melodic sound and Raymond King playing atmospheric cello parts over the almost minimalist beat anchored by heavy bass. George Nakas adds colour with his whammy bar guitar playing.\n\nTrumpet player Goran Kajfes returns for the fourteen minute long \"Speechless \", which mixes modern electronica with both funk (funkadelic meets DJ Shadow) and early underground electronic music (70's Tangerine Dream).\n\nAs with all B.U.C. compositions the music is built around the energic and imaginative bass playing,in this case strikingly simple repetitive synth bass lines.\n\nThe last track \"Saturn Blues\" is basically a modern funky blues with a beat. All musicians featured in this line up of Beat under control reappear in this final track.\n\nUlf Ivarsson plays bass on the album \"Love and you and I\" by Magnatune artist \"Lizzi\"." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/gleusteen> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Canadian born violinist, Kai Gleusteen, started learning the violin at the age of 5 in his native city, Calgary. Early on, Kai met with success in local, provincial, and national music competitions, in addition to receiving top academic awards. He spent the summers at Meadowmount in New York State, at the Aspen Festival, at the Banff School of Fine Arts, and at the Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, California, working with Ivan Galamian, Dorothy Delay, Stuart Canin, and Nathan Milstein. Winters were filled with skiing, badminton, music, and school.\n\nWith the desire of broadening his horizons, Kai chooses to balance his post-secondary education between academics and music. At the University of Michigan, he studied anthropology, geophysics, and philosophy. To his great fortune, he found there the person who would become his greatest inspiration on both a personal and musical level; his violin teacher, Camilla Wicks. After receiving a Master's Degree from Rice University, Kai moved to Europe to live in the heart of Western Culture. Paris and Prague were his bases for nine years, allowing him to develop and perform both as a soloist and leader of numerous orchestras. In the year 2000, Kai won the concertmaster position of the Orchestra 'del Gran Teatre del Liceu' and subsequently moved to Barcelona. In 2003, he formed his own chamber orchestra, the Kaimerata, and was appointed professor at the Escuela Superior de Musica de Catalunya. He continues to perform extensively as a soloist and a recitalist throughout Europe and North America. Kai plays on a violin made by J.B. Guadagnini in 1781.\n\nHaving performed her first recital at the age of twelve, it wasn't until the age of twenty, after two years of law school that Catherine decided to devote herself entirely to music. Taught by Colette Fernier, Monique Deschausse, Sergio Perticaroli, and encouraged by Franais-Reneuche, she received the highest distinction at both the Conservatory in Rouen and later at the Ecole Normale Alfred Cortot in Paris. Catherine was also awarded the Yvonne Lefevre Foundation Prize leading to television and radio broadcasts and concert engagements. Catherine chose to avoid the international competition circuit in favour of taking the time to study repertoire in its historical context. Being a great lover of nature, a fan of Marcel Proust and having spent many years in Normandy, she explores in depth the composers who were inspired by this region, such as Roussel, Debussy, and Saint-Saens. She deepens her understanding of Beethoven, Schumann and Brahms with numerous trips to Germany and her knowledge of the language and by reading Goethe and Heine. Her interpretation of Chopin is nourished by the time spent in Poland and a close examination of his letters.\n\nCatherine's approach to music is very much appreciated not only by solo piano audiences throughout Europe and North America but also by various renowned chamber musicians. She is regularly invited to perform in chamber music festivals throughout these countries and devotes a large part of her time to her duo with Kai Gleusteen and the Trio Liceu." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/junoon> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Junoon is the Urdu word for \"obsession\" and is also is one of South Asia's most popular rock bands. Based out of Karachi, Pakistan, Junoon was formed in 1990 by guitarist/songwriter/medical doctor Salman Ahmad. The band, described by its members as a \"Sufi rock band,\" is considered as one of the most successful in the history of South Asia.\n\nThe name \"Junoon\" came to lead guitarist Salman Ahmad in a dream. In the dream, his teacher was shaking him and saying, \"Tumhey mousiqui ka Junoon hai!\" (meaning \"You have an obsession for music!\"). Shortly thereafter, he formed Junoon with other two friends, Ali Azmat and Brian O'Connell.\n\nJunoon's cult following began with the band's album Talaash (\"the quest\"), and was expanded to a national then international following with releases such as Azadi (\"freedom\") and Inquilaab (\"revolution\").Junoon While most Pakistani performers relied on sampling and highly programmed synth pop, Junoon was one of the first in Pakistan that insisted on playing real, live music. Heavily influenced by rock bands like Led Zeppelin, Junoon aimed at combining loud guitar riffs with the epic tranquility of sufi poetry by the likes of Maulana Rumi, Allama Iqbal and Baba Bulleh Shah.\n\nSuccess came with its attendant challenges. As they tried to defy traditions in a conservative country like Pakistan, Junoon's politically influenced songs were often subject to censorship, which led to the eventual ban from all state run television and radio during the rule of former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.\n\nDespite these difficulties, in 1998, the band took both Pakistan and India by storm with their hit single \"Sayonee\" from the album Azadi (\"freedom\"), their tremendously successful fourth studio album, initially released by EMI. In 1999, Junoon released their fifth studio album Parvaaz (\"the flight\"), based on the poetry of Baba Bulleh Shah. Parvaaz was recorded and mixed at Abbey Road Studios in London and was hailed by critics as Junoon's finest work to date. Junoon won the award of \"Best International Group\" at the Channel V Music Awards in New Delhi, India in November 1999, where they peformed with Sting, Def Leppard, and Prodigy.\n\nIn 1999, UNESCO invited Junoon to perform at their Millennium Peace concert in Paris, which drew an audience of dignitaries from around the world including the heads of the European union and ambassadors from 170 countries. Junoon performed with an aim toward promoting peace and was apparently a hit among many present including Ray Charles, Lionel Richie, Dr. K.J. Yesudas, Montserrat Caballe, and Zubin Mehta. Famous actors Gregory Peck, Sidney Poitier, and Peter Ustinov were the masters of ceremony for the event. Junoon\n\nIn 2003, Salman Ahmad was appointed Goodwill Ambassador by the United Nations, attending a Special Session of the UN General Assembly. Following the 9/11 attacks, Junoon helped to organise a concert at the General Assembly on UN Day with Junoon performing at the actual Assembly Hall, the first such performance of its kind. They also released the single \"No More,\" a song which deals directly with the violence perpetrated on that day.\n\nJunoon is arguably the most successful Pakistani musical group in history and has toured extensively around the world, including a performance at the renowned European rock festival, Roskilde, in June 2000, where they shared the stage with Pearl Jam, Iron Maiden, Travis, and Queensryche.\n\nJunoon's controversial single \"Pappu Yaar\" is known for having shot to the #1 spot in Pakistan. In fact, Junoon's issue oriented music has also helped to keep spirits high amidst deepening social woes on the international stage. Songs like \"Jazba-E-Junoon,\" \"Sayonee,\" \"Talaash,\" \"Main kaun hun\" are issue oriented yet poetic and try to take a big picture view of humankind and its place in the world. As a result, Junoon is often mentioned in the same sphere as Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan or Lata Mangeshkar, yet this rather erudite side did not prevent it from captivating Pakistani youth for well over ten years.\n\nIn their career, Junoon is particularly proud of having played an active role in bringing the people of India and Pakistan together. When tensions were high after the nuclear explosions in 1998, Junoon's' single \"Yaaron yehi dosti hai\" was played enthusiastically across many music channels in India which also found a sizeable audience in Pakistan. Junoon's viewpoints on nuclear testing were even loud enough to reach the White House, and continue to find a foothold in the global exchange of ideas today.\n\nIn 2005, Brian O'Connell returned to his native New York. Pakistani musician Mekal Hassan and the band's producer John Alec have been playing bass guitar for live shows in his place. A reunion concert took place in Dubai, UAE in March 2006.Junoon" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/jeff_wahl> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Upon first listen to a recording of Solo Acoustic Guitarist, Jeff Wahl, you might think that it's a recording of several guitarists playing together at once. However, it's all just one guitar with no overdubs. Audiences who see Jeff play live are also often surprised to see one guitarist sitting on stage yet hear what sounds like 2 or 3 guitarists playing together. Often compared to guitarists such as Leo Kottke, Michael Hedges, Joe Pass, and Will Ackerman, Jeff's style ultimately is a blend of many styles that defies categorization. Jeff's live repertoire encompasses the genres of Folk, Jazz, New Age, Classical and even Indian Ragas.\n\n\"For me, the guitar has always been my therapist and counselor. Playing the guitar and writing music came to me mainly I think because I've had to go through a lot of hard times in my life completely alone. The guitar has always been there for me through it all and I can't imagine how difficult my life would be without it. The inspiration for all of my songs is always a particular emotion I'm experiencing. I usually compose with the guitar in altered tunings so that I can't analyze the sounds through traditional music theory. Although I have a degree in music composition, I find it much more satisfying and authentic to compose through intuition rather than relying on rules of theory. Composing in this way keeps me humble to what the instrument wants to say and helps with keeping my ego out of the way when I write music.\"\n\nJeff's music has been featured often on local and national public radio programs during the last several years. Upon release of his first CD, Guitarscapes in 1999, Jeff was named one of America's best undiscovered guitarists by Guitar 9 Record's online guitar magazine.\n\nJeff grew up on a farm on the eastern plains of Colorado. He played the piano and trombone before discovering his connection with the guitar. He has degrees in music composition and music education. Jeff currently resides in the beautiful city of Fort Collins, Colorado." .

One year later she was a soloist at the Young Artists International Festival in Los Angeles and gave her debut in the Carnegie Recital Hall in New York which received exceptional reviews.\n\nLuiza Borac is the winner of over twenty five national and international awards and distinctions, among them first prizes at Viotti-Valsesia, Italy and the Mendelssohn-Germany International Piano Competition as well as the Mozarteum Salzburg Prize.\n\nIn 2002 she was the winner of the 1st Prize \"Prix d'Oslo,\" the Audience Prize and the Special Prize for the best Grieg interpretation at the \"Concours Grieg\" International Piano Competition in Oslo, Norway.\n\nHer international concert schedule includes recitals at the Concertgebouw Amsterdam, Steinway Hall New York, Radio Hall Hamburg, Palais Pallfy Vienna, Cologne Philharmonie, Puccini Hall Milan, Athenaeum Bucharest as well as many CD, radio and TV productions around Europe and the USA. Luiza Borac performs in festivals including the Grieg Festival in Oslo, Prokofiev Festival at the Barbican Centre London, Aldeburgh Festival, Chopin Festivals in Vienna and Milan, South Bohemian Music Festival, Braunschweiger Classix and Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival.\n\nLuiza Borac has performed as soloist with many orchestras including the Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra, Utah Symphony Orchestra, Bucharest and Cologne Radio Orchestras and The Philharmonic Orchestra of Nations.\n\nShe has also appeared frequently as a chamber musician and has featured in many CD, radio and TV productions around Europe and USA.\n\nLuiza's first recording for AVIE of George Enescu's Three Piano Suites was enthusiastically received throughout the world, not only for her wonderfully idiomatic performances, but also for the truthful quality of the recorded sound. A hybrid-SACD version was subsequently released about which What Hi-Fi? Sound and Vision (UK) said, \"Luiza Borac's take on Enescu's Piano Suites is a testing mix of rapid-fire notes, uncluttered acoustic, and moments of breathtaking subtlety\". In 2005 AVIE released her second recording for the label: Wanderer featuring music by Schubert and Liszt." .

Elements at Loop 10 was composed and recorded at Perez's San Antonio studios and features guest appearances by vocalist Holly Nelson, James Sidlo of Honey Barbera fame, as well as the blissed out guitar craft of Damian Rodriguez.\n\n\"The initial concept was to create an album that had recognizable pop, rock, and electronic elements, but was not anchored to the typical cut and paste format that have become redundant on our airwaves,\" explains Perez.\n\nPerez and Rodriguez' ongoing collaboration led the duo to explore different musical styles, an evolution most noticeable on their Magic Midsummer release, which they released under the name Mosaico.\n\n\"We had just finished Elements and we had already had several ideas for the Seventythree project, but like Elements it required a lot of attention,\" says Perez. \"Every sound and lyric had to be planned and manipulated in our studio. That's where the Mosaico project came in. We needed something raw, we needed the serendipity of rock and roll... with electronic instruments of course.\"\n\nWhether exploring the big electronic soundscapes of Elements and Seventythree or the more spontaneous sound of Magic Midsummer, Perez and Rodriguez consistently turn out darkly beautiful pop and electronic gems?the perfect soundtrack \"for whatever the night brings.\"" .

The quartet applies extensive knowledge of performance practices to music from eleven centuries, reaching out to modern audiences in an accessible and exciting manner. Farallon has performed for the Phoenix Arizona Early Music Society, Bay Area Recorder Series, Atlanta Early Music Alliance, at the American Bach Soloists Summer Festival, and with world-renowned guest artist Marion Verbruggen. Farallon's debut CD, a collection of sacred and secular works by the 16th century composer Ludwig Senfl, was released January 21, 2005.\n\nFarallon Recorder Quartet performs on numerous types of recorder from renaissance to modern, from sopranino to contrabass, from 6 inches to 6 feet tall. Dutch recorder builder Adriana Breukink made a set of ten renaissance recorders especially for Farallon. The quartet performs all its renaissance music on these spectacular instruments, creating a warm and wondrous tone of beauty.\n\nWhile devoting much of their concert programs to renaissance and baroque music, Farallon Recorder Quartet is also active in performing 20th and 21st century music, both well established works, and newly composed pieces, some of which have been written for the ensemble." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/filles> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Les Filles de Sainte-Colombe take their name from Le Sieure Sainte-Colombe, the famous 17th-century composer and player of the viol. Sainte-Colombe gave concerts with his daughters, which delighted European audiences. In this tradition, Mary Springfels and Wendy Gillespie formed the ensemble to perform some of the most vital and imaginative string ensemble music ever composed.\n\nThe ensemble, who are well known performers individually as soloists and as members of various ensembes, are often joined by distinguished guest artists perfoming on harpsichord, organ, lute or voice. The group has given concerts throughout the USA and Europe with the goal of delighting audiences as did the original daughters of Sainte Colombe." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/pantagruel> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Pantagruel has forged a reputation as one of the most exciting and innovative early music ensembles performing today. By delving into the very depths of Renaissance culture their semi-staged performances unearth the archetypal and timeless quality of this music. Hannah Morrison's pure and sweet voice combined with the lilting citterns, gitterns, lutes, and flutes of Dominik Schneider and Mark Wheeler bring to life the passionate music of a distant age.\n\nPantagruel, the hero of a 1532 novel by Francois Rabelais, maintained the motto \"do, what thou wilt,\" and is a fitting name for an ensemble dedicated to exploring innovative methods of performance and presentation. Combining painstaking musicological research with their experience in classical music, rock, jazz, theater, and dance, Pantagruel's performances push the envelop of classical concert conventions by using Renaissance practices of medley, improvisation, and gesture.\n\nRecent Pantagruel performances have included concerts at the National Portrait Gallery in London, the Utrecht Early Music Festival, Munster Baroque festival, and collaboration with Andrew Lawrence-King (Harp Consort, Hesperion XX).\n\nTheir debut CD Elizium breaks boundaries to produce an album of painstaking authenticity, with a structure and intensity that bears comparison with the concept albums of 70's rock bands such as Pink Floyd. Elizium is set in Elizabethan England at the court of the Faerie Queene Elizabeth I, whose influence in modern pop culture can be seen in Tolkiens' Elven Queen Galadriel.\n\nArtist Bios\n\nHannah Morrison (Voyce) The daughter of Scottish and Icelandic musicians, it was in the Netherlands at the Musikhochschule Maastricht that she gained her BA, studying with the soprano Barbara Schlick. She has received further inspiration during master classes with Anthony Rooley, Evelyn Tubb and Andrew Lawrence- King.\n\nDominik Schneider (Flutes, Gittern & Voyce) From an early age he began to play every instrument he could get his hands on, but finally ended up studying the recorder at the Folkwang Musikhochschule in Essen and later renaissance and baroque traverse flutes at the Cologne Musikhochschule.\n\nMark Wheeler (Lutes, Cittern & Gittern) Born in Wordsley/England, he discovered his passion for plucked string instruments while listening to Led Zeppelin. His lute studies with Nigel North at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama in London have been complemented by master classes, with amongst others Jakob Lindberg & Julian Bream." .

Add the presence of Frank Hart's sophisticated arrangements for cello, acoustic guitar, mandolin, dulcimer, organ, recorders and hand percussion, and you get a stellar old world art rock sound with a progressive folk metal edge. This brooding yet accessible music was born of same fertile Houston scene that produced Galactic Cowboys, The Awful Truth, and King's X, which shares some of the Atomic Opera's spiritual focus and prog rock influences." .

Writing, recording and production went on throughout the year and the album was released on Magnatune in January of 2005.

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/mediva> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Mediva is an outstanding medieval group made up of a flexible number of singers and multi-instrumentalists drawn from the leading exponents in their fields throughout Europe. Concerts feature a mix of exotic medieval and Arabian instruments such as oud, saz, shawms, recorders, harp, psaltery, fiddle and percussion as well as a range of singing techniques to suit each repertoire.\n\nCombining slick playing with unusual visual presentation, Mediva creates an experience that is more than just a concert. Full of verve and dynamism, the enjoyment the musicians have on stage is infectious! In addition to Mediva's fresh approach to music making, concerts are often enhanced with dance, poetry, projections and special lighting as well.\n\nAlthough individual members are steeped in the early music tradition, having trained at the Royal Academy of Music, Royal College of Music, Guildhall School of Music and Drama and Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, Switzerland, Mediva has developed a new way to perform medieval music. Rather than trying to recreate the past, performances use medieval music as inspiration for a new sound world and concert experience, relying heavily on improvisation. The group also experiments with modern composition, specially commissioned for the ensemble and works with funk, rock and world musicians for several cross-over projects.\n\nMediva burst upon the early music scene in October 1998 with an outstanding concert as part of the Radio 3 Early Music Day at the Royal Academy of Music. The group is a frequent guest on Radio 4's 'Loose Ends' and have been featured on Radio 3's 'In Tune' and 'Late Junction' and Early Music Show. They made their international debut in 2001 giving a series of concerts at the Barcelona Early Music Festival and were finalists in the International Young Artists Competition at the York Early Music Festival. They were also invited to be guest artists at the Sommer Kurs fur Musik des Mittelalters at the world renowned Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, Switzerland." .

All the musicians possess a rich concert experience, both at home an abroad, which enables free interpretation of the music they play. The members of Nova Casa try to introduce their audience to the abundance of the Baroque music with its variety and scope. The ensemble also occasionally delves into other musical idioms from such countries as France, Italy, and Germany which provides a large context for their baroque and classical selections.\n\nThe Nova Casa ensemble also offers in its programme works by Adam Jarzebski (1590-1648), Marcin Mielczewski (1600-1651) and Stanislaw Sylwester Szarzynski (ca.1700), showing Polish baroque music within the context of stylistic achievements of European music of these days.\n\nRecent performances by Nova Casa include the Huygens Museum in The Hague (4 october 2006) and the ensemble also participated in Van Wassenaer Concours and Festival. Nova Casa has also performed during a Polish Radio broadcast from the ceremony mass at the Evangelical-Reformed Church in Warsaw as well as a concert of Italian baroque music in the Church for Artistic Milieux in Warsaw. At present, the ensemble performs at: XVII Early Music Festival in Warsaw, the \"Cruciixus Est\" Festival in Warsaw, and at the Wawel Royal Castle in Cracow.\n\nNova Casa ensemble members include Ewa Mrowca, Agnieszka Rychlik, Maria Papuzinska-Uss, Jakub Kosciukiewicz and Anton Birula.The name of the ensemble (Nova Casa) comes from the title of the pieces by Adam Jarzebski (1590-1648)?acomposer, poet and architect of the Ujazdowski Castle in Warsaw." .

They had met drummer Nick T. through a mutual friend, and later acquired Marvin S. (through Nick.)\n\nFor about one year the 4 \"jammed\" and wrote some songs, and decided to get serious. The first show played was an instrumental set at a High School Talent Show. Performing their songs Bloody Mary, and Apocalyptica. Though they aren't the most original names, the songs created a very positive response from the audience. Shortly thereafter the band auditioned Jeff Hayward.\n\nIt was with this line-up that the band began writing more songs, and began performing shows. Frequenting at clubs like Traditions (Ridgewood,Queens), and Voodoo Lounge (Bayside, Queens). In mid 1999, the band and Jeff H. decided to part ways, due to creative differences.\n\nIn addition to Jeff leaving the band, Dani (who played guitars at the time) had began going to school in Boston, Ma. With only one guitarist at hand the group had began \"auditioning\" guitarist, and found Ian S. With a rather quick decision, the band decided to take Ian.\n\nWhen Dani came back he took the position of vocals, and keyboards. Since this time, the band has recorded a full length album. Have gotten many positive reviews (from the promos sent out), had the opportunity to take many interviews. and have promoted themselves by playing some great venues" .

This is ensemble playing of great mutual respect and undeniable musicality.\"??Alex Baran, WholeNote Magazine, February 2006\n\nKnown for an inspired synthesis of French and Italian styles, Musica Franca is dedicated to performing the lush compositions written for bassoon and continuo during the baroque period?in particular the work of composers Michel Corrette and Joseph Bodin de Boismortier.\n\nCorrette and Boismortier lived during one of France's most politically turbulent times, but each wrote deeply warm, genial music. Musica Franca easily captures the playful, inventive spirit of Corrette's compositions, with many of the movements displaying the all-or-nothing passion that characterized much of his work. The Boismortier sonatas, by contrast, are treated with infinite subtlety and feline grace?played by Musica Franca with the utmost virtuosity that his work demands. The performances, in fact?with their infinite variations and nuances?reveal the skills that allowed Boismortier to become one of the first composers to succeed without a patron...able to make his living entirely by writing new works of music.\n\nThrough careful selection of the most interesting pieces by these composers, Musica Franca offers a fresh, charismatic perspective on their work. Instrumentation is varied ? sometimes even within the same piece ? in order to bring out the widest range of tonal colors, and Musica Franca performs the music in the same spirit of pleasure as many musicians of the 18th century: light, nimble interpretations performed with both nuance and joy.\n\nThe founding members of Musica Franca (pictured above left to right) are Mathieu Lussier, basssoon; Nadina Mackie Jackson, bassoon; and Fraser Jackson, contrabassoon." .

In 2001 the Wicked Allstars were born in the basement of a duplex just outside of Boston.\n\nWith pipes actually dripping water directly onto their equipment they created their first two songs that summer. \"Forgiven\" is a trip hop song with electric guitar, and \"Trouble-Remix\" is a remix of the Coldplay song \"Trouble\".\n\nSince then, with long periods of school separating them, they have gotten together and finished their first CD.

The Brook Street Band performs small to large scale repertoire ranging from intimate chamber music to concerts with double orchestra and choir.\n\nThe Brook Street Band has performed extensively at Festivals around Britain, including teaching and performing residencies at the Dartington International Summer School. The Band also gives concerts and runs education projects for the Handel House Museum in London.\n\nThe Brook Street Band also believes in commissioning contemporary works for period instruments. Those who have written for the group include the celebrated composer and educationalist David Bedford and renowned composer and vocalist Errollyn Wallen. One of the Band's most notable contemporary projects has been working with Errollyn on a song cycle The Queen and I, initiated for 2003 in anticipation of the 400th anniversary of the death of Elizabeth I." .

He remembers an early affinity for music and rhythm, but didn't begin playing until rather late in life at 17 when he found an old guitar belonging to his sister in the basement of the house they lived in. The guitar had only the three treble strings. Still, this was more than enough to work with. \"The first chord I ever learned was a D chord and I think it was because the guitar only had those three strings\".\n\nA Segovia cassette was another inspiration. \"Finding a Segovia album in post-revolution Iran was not at all impossible, however to me it was more than a call to the understanding of the guitar. It was a call to the understanding of music itself. I realized that the guitar wasn't the instrument, but that music was, and the guitar was simply a tool for the instrument of Music.\"\n\nUpon arriving to the United States Reza enrolled in Los Angeles Valley College. Throughout his attendance there he held first chair in both the LAVC Guitar Ensemble and the Monarch Guitar Quartet, an extension of the guitar department headed by Robert G. Mayeur. \"Performing (solos) was a great lesson for me. Knowing that I had nothing but the music to play allowed me to forget that I was all alone up there.\"\n\nHis musical experiences are wide and varied. \"I wanted to be a great guitar player, but more than that I wanted to be a great musician. And so music in all its forms became appealing to me. I thank my sister for leaving me that old guitar with three strings, and the Creator for blessing my ears. I sometimes wonder what might have happened had it been a didgeridoo.\"\n\nReza's album 'ReStrung' is a collection of original songs that he has been \"re-creating\" for the past ten years. He has been heard to call them practice pieces. \"On most of the songs on 'ReStrung' what you hear, minus the percussion, is one guitar track. So all these songs can be performed as solos. However, they would all work nicely as duets, or even trios and quartets.\"\n\nReza currently resides in North Hollywood, California." .

Masley's also been profiled by NPR's All Things Considered where excerpts from his CD, Mystery Repeats Itself, still occasionally surface in their programming. His song \"Six White Horses\" is featured on the All Songs Considered CD, published by NPR Classics.\n\nMichael is also active politically as \"The Artist General\", a self-created position (similar to the Surgeon General) he has created to represent the interests of artists in the USA.\n\nNote that Mystery Repeats Itself is a compilation of previous works, and includes some songs present on Cymbalom Solos. Masley also plays hammered dulcimer duets with Magnatune artist Jamie Janover on \"All Strings Considered\"." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/phillips> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Cellist, arranger, and composer Barry Phillips explores the line between traditional folk and classical music through beautifully clean arrangements that draw on the past, yet always look ahead to the future. From his recordings of American Shaker melodies to an album of Rumi's poetry set to strings, Phillips' expansive body of work has been gleaned from traditions around the globe and encompasses more than eight centuries of music.\n\nPhillips' newest album Tr?d. is a contemporary celebration of Scandinavian folk songs and original compositions. In addition to Phillips on cello, Tr?d. features two of Sweden's premier players: master nyckelharpist Olov Johansson of the band V?sen and virtuoso fiddler, Olof G?thlin. The album's title combines the abbreviation for the English word \"traditional\" and the Swedish and Norwegian word \"tr?d,\" meaning \"thread.\" It's an album rich with the character of Scandinavian folklore, while its modern, streamlined arrangements make for a sound both elegant and earthy.\n\nPhillips holds a Masters of Music degree in composition from the San Francisco Conservatory and has collaborated with Ravi Shankar on several compositions, including two pieces for celebrated cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. In November of 2002, he accompanied Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton, and other rock luminaries in The Concert for George?a memorial to George Harrison at The Royal Albert Hall in London. He has performed and recorded with such world renowned artists as fiddler Alasdair Fraser, harpist Aine Minogue, and the legendary British rock group Camel.\n\nPhillips' previous recordings include Gourd's Shaker Trilogy (co-produced with William Coulter): Simple Gifts, Tree of Life, and Music on the Mountain. He also composed and produced The World Turned Upside Down, a reinterpretation of popular colonial American music that was featured in the PBS production of Ken Burns' Thomas Jefferson." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/hans_christian> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Hans Christian's musical journey began many years ago in Germany by studying the cello. \"I started to play when I was nine years old and had a private teacher for 10 years. Although my teacher imposed a strict and disciplined approach to learning the instrument I remember him fondly; he was preparing me to go to the music conservatory to become a professional cellist. Deep in my heart, though, I knew all along that this was not going to happen.\" His life was to unfold along different lines.\n\nSince his father was a minister at a Lutheran church in Hanover, Hans played in that church many times and confesses some early musical adventures: \"I would steal the key to the church from my father's desk sometimes and sneak into the church to play there at night. It was dark and cold, but the acoustics were amazing. I am talking about a building in the Neo-Gothic style, big enough for almost a thousand people. So, I would sit in front of the altar, that sacred space, and I didn't know if I was violating God's space or was welcome. I loved those anxious moments and expressed my emotions in wild improvisations.\"\n\nThe unyielding urge to express himself led him to pick up the bass guitar as a teenager and get absorbed in rock music. \"I would play along with Hendrix records, and Santana, Pink Floyd and the Doors. I started to play in local bands in Hanover, dressing outrageously and wearing makeup. I lived out my wild fantasies one night while playing classical music the next day. I liked the discipline of the cello studies and the wildness of the rock bands.\"\n\nPerhaps this duality is a key ingredient to understanding Hans Christian's music and his approach to his own compostions and to his work with RASA, his well-known collaboration with singer Kim Waters. Often starting with a simple melody, Hans weaves an unconventional orchestral treatment that adds a very dense and multi-layered quality to his music, not shying away from any combination of instruments- but always guided by a strong sense of melody and musical development.\n\nHans acknowledges, \"Whether it is with RASA or on my solo projects, I try to keep it very listenable but very interesting, too. I want the listener to travel with the music and have their own experiences.\"\n\nWhen he was 21 years old he decided to move to Los Angeles to study bass at Musician's Institute in Hollywood. It was a big adventure, not knowing anybody in LA and without a place to stay. But within six weeks of his arrival he played at the Whiskey on Sunset Blvd, and within a year he was very connected to the local music scene. \"I played every hole-in-the-wall club you can imagine, constantly playing with many different kinds of groups, from dark and hard-etched bands to folk and performance artists. It was a fulfillment of my dreams because I could do whatever I wanted, and I tried many different things.\"\n\nEventually he worked with established artists like Robbie Robertson, Toni Childs, Victoria Williams, and the Sparks, appearing live and on television. But a persistent urge to express his own ideas kept him on the run. \"I felt a strong pull towards doing my own music, to go deeper, and so I stretched out on the cello, practicing constantly, composing difficult pieces and pushing myself very hard.\"\n\nThis creative drive led him to start his own production company, Allemande Music, expanding into all aspects of music production. Besides recording his own music and the music of RASA, Hans has produced and engineered a rich variety of recording projects with other artists. After almost ten years in the San Francisco area, Hans and his partner, Kim Waters, have recently relocated to Door County, Wisconsin, where they have built yet another recording studio. Hans says about this move that \"I wanted to fulfill this dream of living in a four season environment where it is beautiful, clean, and quiet, so that I can focus on my work more easily. California is a great place to network but it became too exhausting to live there.\"\n\nWhile RASA is the main focus of Hans' musical activities with four CDs in the last four years and an active touring schedule, he has just re-mastered his two most recent solo projects (Phantoms and Surrender) which are re-released through Magnatune.com and a few other companies. Additional solo recordings can be expected in the near future." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/sonnerie> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Sonnerie is one of the foremost and most respected period instrument ensembles in the world. Founded by Monica Huggett in 1982 and based in London, the group has been acclaimed for its performances from Sydney to Paris, and from Helsinki to Vancouver, as well as its numerous concerts at London's prestigious Wigmore Hall. Sonnerie's core group consists of four musicians: Monica Huggett, violin, Emilia Benjamin, violin, viola da gamba and viola, Joseph Crouch, cello and viola da gamba, and Matthew Halls on the keyboards. These four form the basis of the larger chamber ensemble while also functioning as a flexible smaller unit, performing trio sonatas, quartets and the like.\n\nThe group has recorded for Virgin Classics, ASV, Harmonia Mundi USA, Teldec, and CPO with a disc of Vivaldi's Trio Sonatas Op.1. They marked a step into later repertoire with a recording of the Mozart Piano Quartets for ASV. Their most recent releases include a disc of the Biber 1681 Violin Sonatas, together with Nisi Dominus, with Thomas Guthrie, that won a Gramophone Award in 2002; Handel Trio Sonatas, The World's First Piano Concertos with David Owen Norris, and Handel Organ Concertos featuring Matthew Halls.\n\nNotable past engagements include Boston Early Music Festival, Gulbenkian Early Music Days in Lisbon, Vantaa Baroque week in Finland, Kothen Bachfest in Germany, Early Music festivals in Glasgow, Aldeburgh, and Birmingham, a visit to St. Petersburg and tours of the US and Canada.\n\nRecent engagements include the Halle Handel Festival, the Ansbach Festival, the Nordic Baroque Festival in Sweden and the Spitalfields Festival in London. Sonnerie have also performed recently at the Tudeley Festival, the Snape Proms, the Theatre Royal Bath, in Oxford, and at the Wigmore Hall and St John's Smith Square.\n\nMatthew Halls received his early musical training as an organist, working first of all at Southwell Minster and then at Salisbury Cathedral before taking up the organ scholarship at New College, Oxford. He took a first class degree in music and was appointed Assistant Organist at New College and Director of Music at the University Church. Matthew was harpsichordist with the European Union Baroque Orchestra in 1998, touring extensively throughout Europe and the Middle East, and since then has worked as a keyboard player with many of Europe's leading period instrument ensembles. Since 1999 he has been a regular member of the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra, participating in Ton Koopman's ongoing project to record the complete cantatas of J. S. Bach. Recent solo engagements have included concerto appearances in Frankfurt, Nuremberg and at the International Handel Festival in Halle and recitals in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. He joined Sonnerie in 2000." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/rapoon> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "I first began to work seriously with sound in the mid-seventies. I moved into this medium from the disciplines of painting and printmaking. Sound had the added attraction of unfolding over time.\n\nTime is an important aspect in my work. There are references and connections to time running throughout the body of my work from the first to the last.\n\nEarly influences included Can and Neu, Stockhausen and Cage. These gradually gave way to the music that I was discovering myself which was more in line with Eno and Hassell and extreme experimentalists like Throbbing Gristle and Test Department.\n\nI was a founder member of the band :zoviet*france: who are generally regarded as amongst the pioneers of the post-industrial experimental genre and who have influenced many more mainstream bands in the following years.\n\nMy own work has been noted as having a unique style and individuality and has itself fed back into more mainstream genres in the form of commissioned sample libraries, collaborations and re-mixes, and film and installation work.\n\nAs a continuing practitioner in the visual arts I do not draw a clear distinction between the two mediums. The work in both areas is inter-related and cross-referenced. This is perhaps best illustrated by referring to my earliest releases, which were vinyl LP's encased in a succession of unlikely and impractical \"sleeves\". This served at least two purposes; one being to demonstrate that the \"object\" was equally as important as the music contained in the medium. (These sleeves were all hand-made and hand-printed on a variety of materials including hessian, hardboard, aluminum, roofing-felt, ceramic boxes etc. and have since become collector's items as \"art objects\".)\n\nThe second purpose derived exactly from the \"punk\" ethos of doing it yourself and the \"fuck you\" attitude embodied within punk. (We had been told that it was impossible to make these sleeves in any commercially viable quantity and were determined to prove the critic's wrong.)\n\nThe third purpose, of course, was that it set our releases apart from the norm.\n\nWhenever possible I have carried this practice over into later works and continued to place equal emphasis on the artwork included with a release and the object itself, with CDs encased in specially designed, and often hand-made, packaging. The purpose, once again, is to make something \"special\" and to elevate it beyond the usual defining parameters. Subsequently they have become objects of much greater significance to people than they would have been had they been released in ordinary cardboard sleeves or crystal cases.\n\nThe definition of the genre that I work within is one that is also open to interpretation. I think of my work as \"soundtrack\" music and as such it remains open to the inclusion of whatever style I see as relevant. This also allows me to include narrative occasionally e.g. \"Tin of Drum\" includes narrative pieces written and performed by myself. These owe something to David Lynch and Twin Peaks.\n\nA visit to the real Twin Peaks during an American tour prompted me to later write the pieces which were imaginary spoken statements given to the FBI concerning the whereabouts of the narrators on a date some forty-five years previously. The point being that this would be an almost impossible task, yet all the people \"interviewed\" managed to give accounts of the day in question. It didn't really matter if the stories were true or not, the narrators were all glad to have been asked as it somehow gave some kind of meaning to their lives.\n\nThis is reflected in the statements that they make which include details and insights into their lives, as they judge them to be. In this case these characters (like Becket's) judge their lives as essentially pointless and filled with regret.\n\nThe \"Tin of Drum\" in the title is a reference to my own search for some comfort whilst in a situation that at times seemed pointless and wearisome. In the middle of an exhausting and demanding tour where I missed my family and home my \"happiness\" devolved down to feeding my (then) last remaining addiction - tobacco. After running out of the rolling tobacco that I had brought with me from Europe I had been reduced to buying awful, unsmokeable American blends and was growing more and more agitated and depressed. Then at an unpromising gas stop I wandered into the small store and there alone on the shelf behind the counter was a solitary tin of Drum rolling tobacco. (My all-time favourite.) It suddenly became the Holy Grail of salvation; I could almost see a blazing aura of light around it. My body jumped for joy and once again I was confronted with the question \"what do we seek from life\" and what makes us \"happy\".\n\nWe can search for truth and meaning and enlightenment yet seemingly \"bliss\" can be attained with a hand-rolled cigarette of Dutch tobacco and a cup of Italian espresso.\n\nReflections on the human need to attach some kind of \"meaning\" to life could serve as one definition of what my work is about." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/american_baroque> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Founded in San Francisco in 1986, American Baroque brings together some of America's most accomplished and exciting baroque instrumentalists, with the purpose of defining a new, modern genre for historical instruments. The group's adventurous programs combine 18th-century music with new works, composed for the group through collaborations and commissions from American composers. An ensemble of eclectic, accomplished, and artful musicians, the performances bridge a gap between the edges of the new music frontier and the familiar roads to music of the past, and expands the repertoire and scope of historical instruments into the new millenium.\n\nIn its early stages, American Baroque functioned as a studio band, its mission being to record hitherto unknown quartets by Telemann. Recordings of the \"Paris\" quartets and the Fourth Book of Quartets were released and enthusiastically received. In 1991, the group recorded French Cantatas of the 18th Century with soprano Julianne Baird, again released to wide critical acclaim on Koch International Classics. In 1992, American Baroque began exploring the territory of performing new music written for historical instruments through its collaboration with composer, member and gambist Roy Whelden and his pieces Quartet After Abel and Gamba Quartet, which resulted in a CD release on the New Albion label in 1993.\n\nIntrigued by the unique timbres and subtlety of sounds inherent in their period instruments as well as the excitement and anticipation of performing new music, the group continued to pursue projects and programming that involved combinations of new and old elements. Another collaboration in 1995 with Whelden yielded the provocative CD Like a Passing River with poet and reader Rudy Rucker, also on the New Albion label.\n\nSince its founding, the ensemble has been featured at the Tage Alter Musik Festival in Regensburg, Germany; the Berkeley Early Music Festival; the San Luis Obispo Mozart Festival; the San Jose Chamber Music Society; University of California; the San Francisco Early Music Society; on National Public Radio and West Coast Live; and in the Opus415 New Music Festival. In addition, ensemble members perform and record together in the finest period-instrument orchestras in America throughout the year. Recent projects include concerts at the University of Vermont and at Bowdoin College, and a multi-tracked studio recording of Songs of Cold Mountain, a cycle of texts by the 7th-century poet Han Shan. The 1998-1999 season included a commercial recording of eight pieces by the composer's collective, Common Sense, which were commissioned in 1996; and a theatrical and multimedia collaboration entitled \"The Death of Anton Webern,\" written and directed by ensemble member Katherine Shao; the group will present a 2-week run of performances in May 2000.\n\nAmerican Baroque has also received support from Chamber Music America's Millenium Commissioning Program to collaborate with Stanford University composer Jonathan Berger on his new work, Of Hammered Gold (for flute, oboe, violin, viola da gamba and digital bird organ); the work was premiered at Stanford University's Lively Arts series on January 7, 2000. The ensemble has been recognized through grants and awards from the Aaron Copland Foundation, the Mikhashoff Foundation for New Music, and the Zellerbach Family Fund, and most recently won first prize for the 2000 ASCAP Awards for Adventurous Programming. American Baroque remains the only U.S. chamber ensemble committed to performing both new music and 18th-century works on historical instruments, while continuing to explore the issues raised by both genres, old and new." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/ion> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Ion is a new solo venture by established UK musician, David J. Hughes. Most people will know David as the founder member of T-Bass and the last man standing in the SkinMechanix collaboration. Both of these ventures typify the Hughes approach to making music. In other words, foot-on-the-floor, pedal-to-the-metal, full-on electronic power tracks with only an occasional nod towards slower, more romantic moods and feelings.\n\nIon, however, represents a musical tanent for Hughes?a back-to-basics approach with an emphasis on a more symphonic, relaxed sound.\n\nSays David, \"The Ion project came about more or less by accident. In the midst of testing our recently developed ZEIT Step Sequencer, someone forgot to hit the stop button on the recorder and found that we had accidentally recorded more than 20 minutes of random, sequenced noodling, which had no real structure and no real direction. However, rather than just delete the session, we decided to listen ... and came away with the feeling that the music had a raw and unprocessed feel, it was completely natural, unforced and unhurried, the sound of a musician happy to do nothing more than aimlessly wander down strange and previously unexplored pathways.\"\n\nThe end result was the track The Silent Scream, which was editted down from 20 minutes of ambient indulgence to just 5 minutes of actual music. The chords and the lead lines came a few minutes later, composed on the fly and in one pass, with successful takes simply cut and pasted together to build up the layers.\n\n\"We were stunned by the realisation that it was possible to write something that was just about halfway decent in such a short space of time, the music of Ion grew out of this new-found fascination for tightly controlled rhythmic patterns coupled with the joy of re-discoevering the lost art of improvised electronic music.\"\n\nListen to the music of Ion and simply enjoy. Sequencer music doesn't get any better than this." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/indidginus> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Michael Martin has been playing didgeridoo since 1996. His first real foray into dance music came in 1998 after returning from a period of work and travel in Tanzania. Martin attended the Megadog Beach Festival in Cornwall and was so inspired by what he heard and experienced that he decided to incorporate his didgeridoo playing into this style of music.\n\nAt first this effort began with Martin playing along with various techno and trance DJ's as the popular \"Deviant Didg\" at squat parties and clubs in London like The Fridge, Club 414, The Pleasure Rooms, Tyssen Street, and the Drome. Whilst this was good practice, he soon grew rather restless and decided to involve himself in Koru, a drum and bass live PA based in Brixton. (\"PA\" means live electronic performing musicians).\n\nMichael began playing with these techno and trance DJs around London and at festivals like the Lizard Eclipse in Cornwall. This introduced him to the production side of things and he was hooked. He didn't like being a passive member of the band who \"just played didg\". He wanted to actively create tracks from start to end. Studio equipment, however, does not come cheap, so he took out a career development loan, trained as a software developer, earned some extra money, and bought the necessary gear. Shortly after he joined up with another drum and bass live PA (Impact) and gigged with them. This was fun for a while, but he found himself drifting into becoming \"the didg player\" again, so he decided that another change was in order.\n\nFollowing a 2001 Bristol Halloween party at which his psytrance live PA OOOD was playing, Michael got to know Colin Bennun. The two became friends & started writing psytrance tracks together from time to time. He has had the good fortune to work with talented guitarist, Joe Weinstock, who is featured on several Indidginus tracks. Michael is currently involved in a collaboration with Ishq (Matt Hillier) performing under the name Open System.\n\nMichael has played at a wide variety of events in his home country (UK), adopted country (South Africa), and elsewhere in the world. In February 2004 he moved to South Africa, where he has written soundtracks for several TV commercials, a couple of series, and a documentary. He is currently writing the soundtrack to the independent feature film Cognition Factor featuring collaborations with Alex Paterson (The Orb), Colin Angus (The Shamen, Pablo Sandoz) & Merv Pepler (Eat Static)." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/william_brooks> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "William Brooks' story reads like a pack of lies but swears it's all true. William was born and raised just north of The Red River and a tad south of The Arbuckle Mountains in southern Oklahoma. After a dismal, failed attempt at working in the oil business, Brooks packed up camp and moved to New York City. After crashing on the floor of noted author Brett Leveridge(Men My Mother Dated) he finally settled down in what he considers the smallest apartment in NYC's last great red-light district, Hell's Kitchen. William has acted in about a dozen movies and TV shows.\n\nHe has been detained by police on several occasions but never actually arrested, got caught in a revolving door with Bob Dylan, jumped out of more than 7 perfectly good airplanes, waitered in a Chinese restaurant earning the nickname \"Sing Ging Ping\" which translates to \"Neurons Don't Meet\", saw the Beatles in concert, has seen at least 4 ghosts, none of which he knew and is most proud of writing 2 songs with critically acclaimed Rick Moody, author of The Ice Storm.\n\nNative Oklahoman William Brooks has played many of Gotham's most notable digs from The Stephen Talkhouse, The Public Theater, The Continental Divide, Arlene Grocery, Wetlands, Webster Hall and CBGB`s to Tramps and Fez.\n\nI grew up in a small Oklahoma town and have retained most of what that means...courtesy, manners, and a great love of malls.....\n\nI was raised in a house full of women so I learned early to leave the lid down and knock before I walk into a room...\n\nI've lived in NYC for many years and I still smile at strangers, which usually gets me a lotta strange looks back.\n\nMy first 5 years in NYC was one VERY lost weekend, I stepped inside my first Irish pub and didn't leave for 5 years...After my head cleared a bit I eventually figured what I wanted to do, I wanted to be the fifth Beatle but it was too late..so I started writing my own songs as a hobby and of course to impress girls..I did take me a while to realize that while I was busy singing to people at parties, the other guys were snagging the girls..Now I don't sing at parties anymore....\n\nI do perform in clubs with my rock band. do some solo gigs and I love trying out new songs down in the NYC Subway System...You will always get an honest reaction down there...If they love ya you'll know it ... I even have a music video on the web if you'd like to see me make a complete fool out of myself. Just kidding....it's pretty cool....it's at Zebox.com. While I was perorming down in Kerrville Texas at The Folk FestivalI realized I am not a folk artist, I am a folk rocker. There is a huge difference\n\nI love movies, prank phone calls, sushi, buffalos, horses, political news, bad jokes, Tex-Mex, The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Ricki Lee Jones, to laugh, the A minor chord, long silences and old Ford Mustangs..Well that's my story and I'm sticking to it!!!!\n" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/armchair> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "I learned to play arrangements of country and delta blues, ragtime and other early 20th century music on guitar as a beginner. These were contractions of the originals. Notes deeper and higher than what a guitar could sound were squeezed into a narrower range and some complexities had to be removed altogether. The arrangements on Too Much Mustard are quite different. If anything they are expansions in many senses of the word. The harmonic overtones shimmer, dance and bass-lines crab and growl in ways impossible with non-digital instruments. These may be late 19th/early 20th century popular tunes, but they use distinctly 21st century instruments. These arrangements were literally painted using special software, not performed. In many ways they are 21st century equivalents of early 20th century player pianos. In many ways Professor Armchair straddles the centuries.\n\nThis music at its best evokes happiness of a by-gone era. Circuses and carousels and calliopes, oh my! To some they may appear to be pandering, even kitsch. But the truth is they reflect the optimism, the innocence and the fun-loving of our great grandparents. They saw the future as a time for opportunity, for hope, for joy. And what could be bad in that? Few could imagine the horrors of two world wars nor fewer still the attacks of the 21st century.\n\nMany of the titles are obscure, yet some achingly familiar. Where have we heard Me-ow before? In grainy old black and white cartoons of mewling alley cats, most likely, but I've been unable to find such a cartoon in my modest collection (and I have copies of all the Betty Boop cartoons).\n\nIs this music whose time has come and gone? Ragtime's popularity has never completely disappeared. And nearly everyone will associate Funeral March of a Marionette with a certain film director with a highly characteristic, bulbous profile.\n\nOther figures of public notoriety associated themselves with these songs. The title tune \"Tres Moutarde\" (Too Much Mustard) was the theme song of early pilot Lincoln Beachey. Beachey hired bands to play it as he looped the loop in his small stunt airplane before paying crowds of amazed onlookers. He felt the song's title Too Much Mustard suited his personality to a \"T.\" He was just a little too much. The arrangements in this collection are perhaps just a bit too much mustard themselves.\n\nIs this music suitable only for children? As they say in the circus: this is music for \"children of all ages.\"\n\nIf you look behind the curtain, you'll find that Professor Armchair is none other than Magnatue artist Glen Bledsoe." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/jade_leary> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Jade Leary is a fiercely independent artist from Montreal. A musician from a very young age, he evolved from the Montreal underground scene of the late 80s. He has played with renowned avant-rock musicians Bernard Falaise and Remi Leclerc (Miriodor, Klaxon Gueule, Papa Boa) in various projects. His 90's rock band SoulCirkus caught the eye (and ear!) of The Cult bassist Jamie Stewart, and spent 4 weeks on CHOM-FM's top ten list.\n\nIn 2002, well before the current wave of digital downloads, he initiated a project called FairPlay - a distribution model for the new millennium that urged musicians to take matters in their own hands and distribute their music as digital files under a shareware type license. Although the project has since folded he continues to believe in its underlying principles, which are now present in projects like Magnatune and Gabriel/Eno's MUDDA, says Jade, \"when various individuals, from different parts of the world, from diverse backgrounds get the same idea pretty much at the same time, it means this idea's time has come. This is a revolution. We're not going back.\"\n\nA multi-instrumentist, he now works alone, weaving projects that have taken more and more of an intimate and introspective turn. His third album The Lost Art of Human Kindness, his first on the Magnatune label, is a perfect reflection of that tangent. It was featured on Apple's Quicktime web site and media player for several weeks and described in QuickTime News as \"...a surrealistic blend of voice, electronics, and unusual orchestrations that defy categorization.\"." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/rcr> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Rocket City Riot was formed in North Alabama in 1998 by multi-instrumentalist John Mark King as part of the high energy rock movement lead by bands like Electric Frankenstein, The Hellacopters and the Gaza Strippers.\n\nThe following year, RCR recorded its first full-length album, We Name the Guilty Men, and appeared on the first volume of the seminal 13- volume Fistful of Rock-n-Roll compilation series. The next year Scotland's Twenty Stone/Blatt Records released RCR's fit to rave reviews in the U.K. press. Meanwhile, RCR made several compilation appearances in the USA while recording their second album, Middle Age Suicide. They followed that up with Pop Killer in 2003, on which they further perfected their hybrid of pop sensibilities with ass-shaking rock and roll.\n\nWith influences ranging from Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley and Muddy Waters to Iggy and the Stooges, the MC5 and AC/DC, Rocket City Riot bring some much needed substance to the over-commercialized punk-pop scene. With King on lead vocals, bass and guitar, Dave Seiden on lead guitar and Alan Slimak on drums, Rocket City Riot maintains an active live show calendar, proving that fans still crave rock with real character and roots.\n" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/joglaresa> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Joglaresa is a well-established medieval music ensemble and are leaders in the improvisational and cross-cultural aspects of their repertoire. They won an Arts Council of England Early Music Award for their Hebrew/Arabic/Spanish programme Al 'Andalus, and received great critical acclaim for their Crusades programme The Scimitar and the Sword, which represents the voices of Judaism and Islam alongside the Christian viewpoint. Their first album of Judeo-Spanish songs Ballads of Love and Betrayal was released in 2002 (Village Life 010130 VL). Performances include the opening concert at the Aldeburgh Festival and the closing concert at York Early Music Festival; the Queen Elizabeth Hall (London), Brezice Early Music Festival (Slovenia), Istanbul, Amsterdam International Festival of Jewish Music; tours in Germany, Italy and Holland. Broadcasts include BBC Radio 3, 4, and World Service; German, Dutch and Slovenian radio.\n\nJoglaresa's musical style allows improvisational and ornamental freedom to all members of the ensemble, as you will hear on many of these tracks. Each of the Latin hymns is found in various European sources and Joglaresa has decided to pronounce them in an Italian style because most of the vernacular songs are in Italian. Some pieces do not have extant melodies so the medieval technique of contrafactum has been applied and other well- known melodies of the time used.\n\nDirector Belinda Sykes is an international concert and recording soloist. She studied voice and improvisation in Morocco, Bulgaria, Syria, Spain and India; oboe and recorder at the Guildhall School of Music. She has performed/recorded with Red Byrd, New London Consort, Tragicomedia, Harp Consort, Paul O'Dette, Ensemble Unicorn, Sarband, Dufay Collective and Oni Wytars and is Professor of Medieval Song at Trinity College of Music. As an oboist she has played for the Gabrieli Consort, English Concert, King's Consort, BBC Symphony Orchestra, Age of Enlightenment and Hanover Band, and has collaborated with many composers including Sir Harrison Birtwistle." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/pbo> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Named Musical America's \"Ensemble of the Year\" for 2004, San Francisco's Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra has dedicated itself to the historically-informed performance of Baroque, Classical, and early Romantic music on original instruments since its inception in 1981. Under the leadership of Nicholas McGegan, Music Director since 1985, Philharmonia has become \"an ensemble for early music as fine as any in the world today,\" according to Los Angeles Times critic Alan Rich. The Orchestra performs a subscription season in four cities in the San Francisco Bay Area, and is regularly heard on tour in United States and internationally. In addition to Mr. McGegan, the Orchestra has welcomed eminent guest conductors to its podium including William Christie, Andrew Parrott, Jordi Savall, Gustav Leonhart, Monica Huggett and Stanley Ritchie.\n\nUnder the direction of Mr. McGegan, Philharmonia has made several United States tours, each of which included an appearance on the Great Performers Series at Lincoln Center. Other appearances include debuts at Carnegie Hall (NY) and Walt Disney Concert Hall (Los Angeles) in February 2005. In August of 2005 the Orchestra made its debut at the BBC Proms, Snape Maltings (UK) and The Concertgebouw in Amsterdam.\n\nIn August 2002, the Orchestra made its Mostly Mozart Festival debut with five performances including a concert featuring Handel's newly-discovered Gloria in excelsis Deo and four performances of Handel's L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato with Mark Morris Dance Group. A return engagement in August 2003 featured the Orchestra in the Festival's first fully-staged opera, Mozart's Il re pastore. In March of 1998 Philharmonia performed Handel's Saul and Hercules at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and in 1999 the Orchestra made its European debut at the International Handel Festival in Gottingen, Germany, with return appearances in 2001 and 2002.\n\nIn 1990, Philharmonia began an extremely successful collaboration with the Mark Morris Dance Group. In May of that year, the Orchestra appeared at the Brooklyn Academy of Music with the Dance Group in Morris' production of Purcell's Dido and Aeneas. Subsequent performances have included a program of mixed works featuring Vivaldi's Gloria; Handel's L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato, presented again in March of 2000 and September of 2003 by UC Berkeley's Cal Performances; and the American premiere of Morris' production of Rameau's ballet-opera Platee, which was the tour de force of the 1998 Berkeley Festival. Platee was again performed in September 2001 in Los Angeles and Berkeley." .

The result is a decidedly hip blend of salsa and funk, infused with distinctly Argentine elements.\n\nThe members of Mutandina are:\nAriel \"Cordero\" Polenta - piano, Wurlitzer, Hammond, keys, voices, arrangements\nChristian \"Turco\" Fahiad - drums, percussion\nNicolas Luis Humberto \"Rigo\" Quesada - guitars, voices\nMarcos \"Mariomarqueti\" Archetti - bass, voices\nMatias \"Mato\" Ruiz - acoustic and electric guitars, tenor sax, composition, arrangements and lead vocals.

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/thornside> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "First, a true story.\nWhen Thornside was in his mid twenties, he worked at McDonalds. Believe it or not, he came so far as to being a \"white shirt\", bossing around. But of course Thornside had a boss over him, a crazy but nice man from Iran. When he heard that Thornside sang and played the trumpet, he immediately insisted (or \"decided\" is probably the right word) that Thornside should play for the guests between four and five every Tuesday. Thornside called his old friend Burnshee, with whom he was playing in different bands, and asked him to play with him. They formed a duo, performing jazz standards and some dixie, in the corner of the McDonalds restaurant at Kungsgatan in Stockholm, Sweden. Thornside singing, playing trumpet and banjo, and Thornside playing the guitar. Two hundred Swedish kronor and a free meal was the deal. And the start of what 15 years later would be Burnshee Thornside, the funky jazzy whacky duo from Sweden. (What the guests thought at the moment is not very clear. One thing is for sure: they did not come only to hear Thornside and Burnshee.)\n\nIt started in the early 80's\nJohan Nilsson and Jens Henriksson - Burnshee Thornside - met in their teens and formed many bands playing mostly funk. It was the days of the \"slapping bass\" so you had to get hold of a good bassplayer, who knew how to use his thumb. Compared to the rock bands, you also had to have horns, and you had to know how to arrange for horns. Trumpets, saxophones, trombones. Thornside, being also a trumpet player, knew that, so we had great horn arrangements from day one. We made a lot of our own music, played many gigs, and we listened to Earth Wind & Fire, Kool & The Gang, Steely Dan, Koinonia, Gino Vanelli, Chaka Khan, Rufus, James Brown, jazz and blues, Zappa, Weather Report... Sometimes Burnshee and Thornside would meet up in the rehearsal studio to record together, on their own. A little pleasure they had, together with the 4-track Fostex Cassette Recorder. It sounded very Motown...\n\nThe year 2003\nAfter pursuing different careers (IT, Advertising, computers), of course neither Thornside or Burnshee made a living out of music, altough it gave some good extra money, Burnshee finally made one of his dreams come true: his own studio in the basement. Based around a Mac G4 and Logic. All of a sudden Burnshee and Thornside were back were it all started. Recording, making music, composing, arranging. They looked at each other and decided to start all over. But first they had to get rid of their Swedish sounding names - Johan Nilsson and Jens Henriksson - so they named themselves Burnshee Thornside and their first recording in the new studio was of their old song \"Hey Hey Hey\" (which now appears on the Burnshee Thornside Album Blues and misc.) After that they composed 14 brand new songs and invited the magic musician Tomas Bergquist in to play drums and bass (he is still with us). The releasing of \"The Art Of Not Blending In\" was quite successful, there being no record label behind it. We got some airtime on a small radiostation in Oregon, and Australia, and we sold some albums via magnatune.com who supported us from the start. Everybody said it sounded like Steely Dan and Michael McDonald, mostly thanks to Thornside's voice, we guess, but also due to the fact that the music is kind of Rhythm & Blues. With a jazzy feeling. And then a bit funky. And with horns. The lyrics, that's quite another story. They are not only about love. They can be about anything...\n\nThe years 2004 and 2005\nIn 2004 Burnshee Thornside released \"Blues & misc.\", as the title reveals, a whole lot of blues, but also funky jazzy stuff, 12 tracks. A bit more simple. Not as many horn arrangements. Not as many background vocals performed by great sounding female singers. But still very good. (Some regard \"Blues and misc.\" as better than \"The Art Of Not Blending In\".)\n\nAnd then, in 2005, came \"Rock This Moon\". 15 new tracks, back to more horns, more background vocals, more 70's jazzy/funky Steely Dan-ish. With fun, intriguing and whacky lyrics.\n\nIs this only the beginning? Yes, we think so! And maybe, just maybe, one day people will come to McDonalds only because Burnshee Thornside is playing in the sound system." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/serenissima> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "La Serenissima was founded in 1994 for a performance of Antonio Vivaldi's La Senna Festeggiante (RV 693). Since then, it has given the U.K. premieres of many Vivaldi works including Ottone in Villa (RV 729), Giustino (RV 724) Tito Manlio (RV 717), Tremori al braccio (RV 799), the Concerto per la Solennita della S. Lingua di S. Antonio in Padova 1712 (RV 212), the concerto Il Proteo o sia il Mondo al Rovescio (RV 572), and the violin sonata (RV 798). The group also gave the UK premiere of Albinoni's Il Nascimento dell'Aurora for the Spitalfields Festival in 2001.\n\nThe ensemble, led by Adrian Chandler, has been in wide demand appearing in many festivals including Lichfield, Warwick, Southwark, Spitalfields, Bruges, Beverley, and Copenhagen. They have toured Le Quattro Stagioni to Venice, London, and Glasgow, receiving rave reviews in The Independent. Other engagements have included virtuoso recitals in Belfast, for the BBC in London, Glasgow and Belfast, and various concerts of Vivaldi's orchestral music.\n\nThis is La Serenissima's first recording, but they will return to the recording studio next year to record a disc of Vivaldi concerti entitled Vivaldi in Arcadia. They have also broadcast for Classic fM, Danish Radio, and Belgian Radio.\n\nAdrian Chandler was born in Merseyside in 1974. He studied at the Royal College of Music with Rodney Friend and Catherine Mackintosh. Whilst he was an undergraduate there, he founded La Serenissima with whom he has given many recitals and concerts.\n\nAdrian has led many British early music ensembles such as the Musicians of the Globe, the Gabrieli Players, the Classical Opera Company, the Avison Ensemble, Concerto Caledonia, the New London Consort and also his own ensemble, La Serenissima.\n\nHis broadcasts include work for BBC Radio 3, Radio Scotland, Dutch Radio, Radio Belgium, Radio France, Radio Denmark, Classic fM and Japanese TV.\n\nGareth Deats studied at the University of Southampton before going on to complete a postgraduate course at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama with Anthony Pleeth. He has recorded for television, radio and on compact disc and has performed throughout Europe. Apart from his work with La Serenissima, Gareth has played principal cello for the Classical Opera Company, Cambridge Baroque Camerata, The Avison Ensemble, Charivari Agrable and the Galeazzi Ensemble.\n\nRobert Howarth studied music at the University of York. He now works as a harpsichordist for La Serenissima, Ricordo, The Avison Ensemble, The English Baroque Soloists, Florilegium and the Gabrieli Players.

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/latham-koenig> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Jan Latham-Koenig, born in England in 1953 of French, Danish and Polish descent, studied at the Royal College of Music. After winning all the major conducting and piano prizes and a Gulbenkian Fellowship, he first made his mark as a concert pianist, but in 1981 decided to concentrate exclusively on conducting. He has conducted most of the major orchestras in Britain including the Royal Philharmonic, Philharmonia, London Philharmonic, Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, Royal Scottish National, Halle and all the BBC orchestras. With his own group, the Koenig Ensemble, which he founded in 1976, he has conducted many ambitious and highly-successful projects. From 1989 to 1992 he was Music Director of the Orquestra do Porto, which he formed at the instigation of the Portuguese government.\n\nMusic Director of both the Orchestre Philharmonique de Strasbourg and Opera du Rhin since the 1997-98 season, his work there has been very favourably received. Recent productions have included Turandot and Elektra, and the ballet Prince of the Pagodas. His production of Dialogues des Carmelites won the Claude-Rostand prize for Best Regional Opera production (1999) and also the Diapason d'or for the best opera video (2001). His other Strasbourg productions have included Macbeth, La Bohme, Peter Grimes, Tristan, Pelleas et Melisande, Korngold's Die Tote Stadt and Carmen. In May 1999, he brought the orchestra to the Barbican, London, for a Gala concert in celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Council of Europe, returning in 2002 for a highly-acclaimed performance of Berlioz's The Damnation of Faust. Also in London, Latham-Koenig has conducted the Opera du Rhin in his much-praised Dialogues des Carmelites at the BBC Proms. Other opera performances abroad have included Henze's Venus & Adonis (Genoa), Tosca (Bastille), Dialogues, Jenufa and Hamlet (Royal Danish Opera) and I Lombardi (Santiago, Chile). He regularly performs with this orchestra at Chatelet, Baden-Baden and in other venues in France. Other recent tours include Wroclaw, to perform Szymanowski's King Roger, and Greece.\n\nJan Latham-Koenig's guest conducting takes him to many countries. He has appeared with orchestras worldwide: in America, with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and St Paul Chamber Orchestra; in Japan, with the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony and Tokyo Symphony; in France with the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France and Orchestra National Bordeaux Aquitaine; in Europe with orchestras including the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic, Rotterdam Philharmonic, the Danish and Swedish Radio orchestras, Stockholm Philharmonic, Dresden Philharmonic, Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin and the orchestras of Westdeutscher Rundfunk, Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk and Sudwestfunk in Germany. He enjoys performing in Italy, and has performed with the orchestras of the Teatro Comunale in Florence and RAI Turin. In 2001, he gave several concerts with the Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome and last season made a most successful concert debut with Deutsche Oper Berlin.\n\nOpera is a particular interest. From 1988 to 1990 he held the position of Principal Guest Conductor at the opera house in Rome. In 1988 he made an impressive debut at the Vienna State Opera (Macbeth) and was immediately re-invited for performances of Aida in May 1989. As Permanent Guest Conductor he conducted well over 100 performances there, including major revivals of Maria Stuarda and Macbeth, and, in 2001, Un Ballo in Maschera, La Traviata and I Puritani. His many European performances have taken him to the Royal Opera House (Covent Garden) and English National Opera; to the Bayerische Staatsoper, Deutsche Oper, Berlin, and Hamburg State Opera; to Verona Opera and La Fenice (Venice), and to Royal Danish Opera, Royal Swedish Opera and the opera houses in Genoa, Lisbon, Toulouse, Monte-Carlo, Bonn, Stuttgart and Bilbao. He has also visited the opera house in Santiago (Chile) and Canadian Opera. Opera festivals include Bregenz, Caracalla (Rome), Wexford, Macerata, Maggio Musicale in Florence, Torre del Lago, Vicenza, Bergamo, Lucca, Montepulciano and Montpellier. Opera broadcasts include Puccini's Edgar and Szymanowski's King Roger for Danish Radio; a cycle of Weill operas and radio cantatas for WDR and, in early 1999, Dialogues des Carmelites, broadcast nationwide by French television from the Opera du Rhin.\n\nIn 2001, Latham-Koenig and embarked on a notable new series of recordings, with Orchestre Philharmonique de Strasbourg, for Avie. Most recently he garnering international acclaim, including a Gramophone Editor's Choice and a Choc du Monde from Le Monde de la Musique, for the first CD release of Ibert's early two-act opera Persee et Andromde. Their first release for Avie was Franck's Symphony in D coupled with extracts from Psyche. For Capriccio he has recorded a Weill cycle including Mahagonny with Anja Silja, Der Zar lsst sich photographieren, Der Lindberghflug, Magna Carta, Der Silbersee, Happy End, Der Kuhhandel and Street Scene. His discography also includes Donizetti's Poliuto with Martinucci, Connell and Bruson (Nuova Era), Catalani's Dejanice, Henze's La cubana, Leoncavallo's La Boheme (Nuova Era) and Donizetti's Elisabetta al castello di Kenilworth (Ricordi). His three William Walton releases form part of the Chandos Walton cycle including the Violin Concerto (Lydia Mordkovitch), Viola Concerto (Nobuko Imai) and Facade Suites Nos. 1-3 with the London Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\nRecent seasons also included a very successful and ambitious concert presentation of La Boheme in the Amsterdam Concertgebouw with Netherlands Radio Philharmonic, consisting of Act I of Puccini's opera and Acts III and IV of Leoncavallo's; appearances with Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre National de Belgique and guest conducting in Europe and the Far East. Recent repertoire has included Mahler's massive Eighth Symphony, Britten's War Requiem and Janacek's Glagolithic Mass.

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/jag> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "I started playing rock guitar in 1978. OK, I banged on it a few times in 1976 but that doesn't count. I started playing in a cover band in Little Rock while still in high school. You know the story; Zep, Who, Stones, Skynyrd, etc.\n\nI did that for a few years then started to teach guitar while in college. I opened up my own recording studio in 1984 (still in business) and recorded about 40 90 minute cassettes of my own music over the next 20+ years. This was more experimental/rock/imporovisation music in the vein of old Pink Floyd or Captain Beeheart.\n\nI got into blues after discovering Robert Johnson and RL Burnside in 1998. I had heard lots of blues over the years but the only artist I really liked was Stevie Ray Vaughan. My music sounds nothing like him however. I had put down my guitar for a few years after getting hooked on computers. I only played sporadically but I noticed that I was abscent mindedly playing old blues riffs.\n\nI remembered that I had the Robert Johnson box set from the 30's and I started listening to it, not really intending to learn that style. A co-worker at the time was listening to internet radio and one fo the stations played lots of old blues artists like Son House, Mississippi Fred McDowell and of coure Robert Johnson. I was immediately hooked on the raw, funky style and investigated further.\n\nLearning these songs by ear was difficult as many are tuned differently from traditional guitar tunings and many artists of that era used capos to change keys which made it almost impossible to figure out what the tunings were. Eventually I stumbled across a video of Bukka White playing what looked like open E tuning. I tried it and voila! I was playing Robert Johnson licks in no time.\n\nI recorded my first 4 cd's in a little less than 12 months, 3 more followed in quick succsession.\n\nAfter years of playing complicated and almost orchestrated music that took days or weeks to record one song, it was refreshing to be able to knock out several songs in a day with just a guitar and a microphone. The fingerstyle picking allows the guitarist to use the thumb for the bass notes the the first and second fingers for the melody and chords. A full band can be imitated with just one guitar in this manner. This is one of the defining techniques of country blues (also know as delta blues). I've also taken up the blues harp which is featured in many of my songs as a solo or melodic intrument.\n\nI'm also recording what I call 'full band' blues at home on my trusty 7500 Macintosh which includes electric guitar, bass, drums, and even some electronica influences. Many of these songs reference the minimal sounds of the Chess Records recordings of Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf and Little Walter. So far I have recorded two CD's of 'electric blues'. I hope you enjoy my music - many people believe the blues is a dyiing art from ut nothing coudl be further from the truth, if anything it's growing and web sites like Magnatune can do nothing but help further 'the cause'." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/sun_palace> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Sun Palace is the musical vision of vocalist, songwriter, and musician Andriette Redmann, who was raised on a Wisconsin cherry farm that doubled as an artist colony?a place she describes as \"a combination of Ringling Brothers and a Bergman film.\" Andriette came from a musical family going back many generations and her earliest inspiration was her aunt, Frances Martinsek, a popular accordianist of the 1930's and 40's.\n\n\"Aunt Fran had me singing in front of audiences at the age of four in her cast-off silk and satin gowns,\" says Reddman. \"I loved her stories about playing for the Milwaukee Braves, the Green Bay Packers, and the German Chancellor.\"\n\nAs adulthood approached, Andriette launched herself into world travel and musical exploration, learning about jazz at Berklee College of Music, classical at Hunter College, and punk, electro-pop, and Bulgarian folk singing in New York City.\n\nSoon after her arrival in New York, Andriette landed a recording contract with CBS Italia Records. \"Performing in Itay was an absolutely 'Felliniesque' experience,\" she says. My band and I were appearing on Italian TV, playing in the popular 'FestivalBar,' and hanging out with the Italian rock stars. The wine, the food, the song?every moment was chaotic and surreal!\"\n\nThen tragedy struck, her parents passing away within two years of each other, and Andriette considers her time spent caring for them precious. \"Nothing can prepare you for the extreme feelings of losing both your parents,\" she says, \"especially when it happens when you're so young. I felt I was looking down over the sharp edge of the world and gazing into a black, bottomless abyss.\" Grief-stricken, Andriette continued to search for meaning through music and various esoteric studies in psychology and bodywork, finding inspiration through the pursuit of sacred Hawaiian Hula dancing.\n\nThe spirit genrated by Andriette's quest also led to the creation of Sun Palace, and its debut CD, Into Heaven, which featured ten songs dealing with death, life and the reflection of beauty that comes from both. With co-producer and guitarist John Rokosny (Smithereens/Carry Nation) onboard, along with lead guitarist Tony Geballe (DGM artist/Trey Gunn Band/Toyah/theatrical composer), Sun Palace began to enjoy national attention. The song \"Into Heaven\" was featured in the soundtrack of the film, Indian Fish, and the song \"Your Hands Lie Open\" appeared in national ad campaign. Songs from Into Heaven went into heavy rotation on XM Satellite Radio, and all Borders bookstores showcased the disc as well.\n\nIn 2005, Sun Palace announced the release of its critically acclaimed new album, Give Me a Perfect World: a delicately buoyant work of lush, layered folk-rock that Andriette lovingly dedicated it to her late brother and gifted musician, John Redmann, who appears on the recording, along with sister Marise Redmann. The record also features an illustrious lineup of major league recording industry veterans, including legendary drummer and percussionist Jerry Marotta (Peter Gabriel/Paul McCartney/Elvis Costello), Smithereens frontman Pat DiNizio, cellist Jane Scarpantoni (Springsteen/Lou Reed/REM), and drummer Mark Brotter (HEM).\n\nSays Andrietti: \"Give Me A Perfect World is ready for the world.\"" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/skin_mechanix> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "SkinMechanix was a prolific collaboration between the UK's Dave Hughes and avant-garde sound experimentalist, Skin. The objective was to get back to basics, to reclaim some of the joy of creating original music, and to work with some new and previously untried techniques. The end product was something very special indeed?strong melodies and challenging arrangements, dance rhythms fused with throbbing retro sequences and fiery electronic soundscapes, all welded together to occupy a unique territory in the UK synth music scene.\n\nTechnical issues meant that the early SkinMechanix demo tapes were not viable, however, so Hughes began re-recording and rearranging the source material to form the basis of a more commercial release. These efforts proved highly successful and the debut album The Secret Life of Angels was released in September 2002. The album made its debut at Jodrell Bank Planetarium that month and the audience reaction was very positive and enthusiastic. After quickly gaining a number of excellent reviews and a great deal of airplay around the world, SkinMechanix continues.\n\nLive concerts are now a regular feature. So far, SkinMechanix have performed at three concerts in the Awakenings series, two as the headline act. The disc Fallen Angel was recorded at the Awakenings concert in February 2005 and features both live and studio pieces. Fallen Angel was released as a limited edition disc in December 2005 and was sold out completely within two days.\n\nThe band remains highly active with new material emerging throughout 2006 and 2007." .

The flamenco guitar of Miguel\n\nEspinoza and the East Indian tabla of Ty Burhoe bring together two passionate and ancient traditions into one music.\n\nSince the initial release of their first release \"Curandero\" in 1995, they have toured extensively in the US and are responsible for initiating the exciting blend of flamenco with the rhythms of India. They have had a wide variety of special guest artists ranging from Howard Levy (Harmonica Virtuoso), to Kai Eckhardt (Bass) and Bela Fleck (Banjo).\n\nIn 1997 they produced another cutting edge CD called \"Aras\" which featured a whole new breed of composition, letting go of traditional roots and embracing a more creative musical possibilities. Miguel's amazingly diverse musical back ground gave incredible harmonic depth to the compositions and became a perfect invitation to musicians from very different musical traditions. Thus, banjo maestro, Bela Fleck and the intensely lyrical bass playing of Kai Eckhardt were woven into the music of \"Aras\". The albums have been featured in dozens of top play lists around the world and magazines such as Guitar Player, Acoustic Guitar, Rhythm Music and many others.\n" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/thursday_group> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Guitarist Douglas Lichterman writes:\nI began my musical life at 8-years-old when I embarked on seven years of training as a classical violinist, studying with the concert master of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, Mischa Mischakoff, after surviving a few years of lessons with his wife.\n\nSerious as I was about that -- I thought it would be my career at the time -- it was another moment that foreshadowed my life as a musician. I was around 11 and had been taken into Wayne, Maine, a town near where I went to summer camp, to watch a parade. Leading the parade was the drum corps, and as those guys came marching toward me playing their snare drums, my entire metabolism changed forever. I begged my parents for a snare drum and acquired the rest of the set over the next couple of Christmases.\n\nSoon after, I started playing drums in rock bands around Detroit before I discovered and subsequently took up the guitar. That led me to became a full-fledged guitar player and singer-songwriter and to drop out of the University of Michigan and head west to San Francisco to be near the Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead and start a San Francisco rock band.\n\nOf course, by then I'd dropped violin -- and my initial career dreams of a classical musical -- altogether. My San Francisco rock band, WINDOW, lasted for six years. During that time I became very interested in Jazz and started studying Jazz guitar with the one and only Bill Connors (first electric guitarist in Chick Corea's RETURN TO FOREVER), which changed almost everything about my technique and approach to music. I became a practice-aholic, sitting in front of my music stand for several hours every day.\n\nAround that time, I also was introduced to Middle Eastern music by a great teacher from Iran who first put a dumbek -- a type of handrum -- into my hands. Since then I have spent a lot of time playing dumbek for belly dancers as part of several troupes.\n\nWhen WINDOW ended, I started a progressive Jazz project called THURSDAY GROUP which soon moved from San Francisco to New York City, where we performed, recorded two albums and toured the U.S.\n\nTo say the least, it's been a pleasure to work with this band and watch it develop as we have built a repertoire of original music and performed around the city." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/thebots> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "The Bots illustrate a future where artists, actors, performers and all sorts of media figures will be not human, but sophisticated human-like simulations. That this will happen is a simple issue of economics. As artificial personality simulations become more effective, entertainment conglomerates will find human \"creatives\" and \"stars\" to be increasingly irrelevant, replaceable, and disposable.\n\nUnrecognized, low wage human creative labor will toil behind the scenes to bring you \"stars\" who are nothing more than 3d models and speech synthesizers. This was predicted by science fiction author Norman Spinrad in the classic book, \"Little Heroes.\" The Bots are Spinrad's fantasy come to life. Nowadays, most of the examples we have are in the videogame industry, where voice actors are usually synced to the animated 3d models because of the difficulties of creating acceptable results from the current crop of speech synthesizers. But that's a technical problem, one which The Bots have already solved.\n\nThis is all rather revolutionary in the context of musical entertainment, but The Bots have an unexpected agenda.\n\nAnticipating a future where media corporations will use this technology to consolidate their exploitation of the creative classes, The Bots are staking out this territory first. We are here as entertainment, a warning of what is to come, and a vehicle for casting a suspicious eye on the powerful.\n\nMost importantly, The Bots are here to demonstrate entertainment technology as a force for good, a force for freedom, rather than a mind-numbing tool of corporate control. Synthia v2 is the most advanced human simulation on the planet. Most observers agree that she has more personality and lyrical depth than most if not all of the human female divas on the pop charts right now. In fact, Synthia's not even playing their game. She's on a larger mission for world peace, love and harmony. Really.\n\nThe Bots don't think of themselves as rebels, though you might think of them that way, depending on your perspective. The Bots simply stand for truth, and justice, rocking out, and having a good time. When The Bots are critical of existing social structures, policies, and taboos, it is not out of an infantile spirit of unfocused \"rebellion\" which has been so effectively co-opted by corporate mind controllers. No, The Bots don't fit into the corporate \"rebel\" rock image. They are too sophisticated for that. The Bots not only criticize existing structures, but they offer clear alternatives. This makes them very dangerous to the system of control.\n\nThe Bots want you to think for yourself, and throw off the yoke of media fabrication and corporate mind control. The Bots want to encourage you to think a little more deeply about our planet, our future, and our interaction with technology.\n\nThe Bots have been around since about 1992, when the first Presidential Mix, Bushwack, was released under the name Tone Def. Bushwack utilized The Bots revolutionary Presidential Truth Filter, which extracts truthful statements from vast wastelands of presidential obfuscation and distortion.\n\nLater, in about 1996, The Bots employed speech synthesizers to create one of the first downloadable songs on the internet. Smoky, Paul Bot and Fred Bot created the song \"Fuck You\" in general midi and soundfont format, as mp3 files were still in the future. Through a series of recordings, The Bot Brothers, as they originally called themselves, displayed a bad attitude and an angry sarcasm that was unmistakeable. Years later, Synthia joined The Bots and the band went in a slightly different direction. Her recipe was to add a little bit of sugar to the mix. Now The Bots are as angry and critical as ever, but it is all filtered through a prism of hope, love, and humor.\n\nIf you simultaneously feel like dancing,laughing and crying, you must be listening to The Bots. We're making it \"real\" here in every way. In spring 2004, with the release of Fuzzy Math, Truth, and the signing to Magnatune, The Bots are on a roll.\n\nWe believe Magnatune is the perfect forum for The Bots. Because The Bots are critical of corporate control in all sectors of society, the same holds true for our view of the music industry itself. Much of this industry really is evil, as Magnatune's slogan implies. Artists and consumers have both suffered at the hands of unscrupulous media companies. Placing profit above art is only one problem. How many lives were lost as a result of Clear Channel's sponsored \"pro war\" rallies prior to the attack on Iraq? How many artists depend on Clear Channel for any chance at sustaining themselves? How many were muzzled from casting a dissenting voice in the runup to the war? How many artists reluctantly went along with their record labels' persecution of file traders? (well, some like Metallica, had no reluctance at all...)\n\nWe believe it is the responsibility of true artists to express a celebration of freedom, not to knuckle under to a system of corruption and corporate control. We stand for freedom and your right to party. Come on and join us. Let's crank the music and dance!" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/ruiz> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Gonzalo X. Ruiz is one of America's most acclaimed historical instrument soloists. He is joined by the crack continuo team of cellist Joanna Blendulf and harpsichordist Katherine Shao. The ensemble is named after Francois LaRiche, one of the first great oboists, and a Zelig-like character. He influenced the writing of Purcell, Handel, Telemann, Bach, and Vivaldi, and was a bit of a Johnny Appleseed for the oboe. LaRiche & Co. is committed to reviving and preserving the legacy of the oboe's 18th Century Golden Age. The San Francisco Classical Voice raved about LaRiche's debut: \"...a spellbinding program. Though the members of LaRiche shone individually, it was their ensemble playing that made the afternoon truly remarkable\".\n\nGonzalo Xavier Ruiz has appeared both as principal oboist and concerto soloist with most of the leading period instrument groups in America and has performed widely in the U.S. and Europe under conductors such as Christopher Hogwood, Nicholas McGegan, Jordi Savall, Gustav Leonhardt, Reinhard Goebbel and Mark Minkowski. His playing is featured on numerous recordings of solo, chamber, and orchestral repertoire. Equally accomplished on the modern instrument, he has performed as principal oboist of the Buenos Aires Philharmonic, New Century Chamber Orchestra and the Pacific Chamber Symphony among others. Mr. Ruiz was a prizewinner at the Brugges Early Music Competition in Belgium and for many years has been professor of oboe at the Oberlin Conservatory's Baroque Performance Institute. He has also taught at the Longy School in Cambridge and given master classes at Indiana University. An active chamber musician, he has made numerous reconstructions and arrangements, notably from the works of Bach and Rameau. Twice he's been a featured recitalist at the annual convention of the International Double Reed Society. Mr. Ruiz is an acknowledged expert in historical reedmaking techniques, and over two dozen of his pieces are on permanent display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. With his ensemble American Baroque Mr. Ruiz is also active in the field of contemporary music and was awarded the 2000 ASCAP Award for Adventurous Programming. Ruiz also performs with American Baroque.\n\nBaroque cellist Joanna Blendulf, a native of Sweden, has diverse musical interests, performing in chamber ensembles and orchestras throughout the United States. She received her musical training at the Cleveland Institute of Music and Indiana University, where she studied with Stanley Ritchie, Tsuyoshi Tsutsumi and Alan Harris. In 1998, Joanna received the prestigious Performer's Certificate from the Indiana University faculty for her achievements on baroque cello. Spending much of her time in transit, she is currently performing with the Portland Baroque Orchestra, American Bach Soloists, the Indianapolis Baroque Orchestra, Jubilate Baroque Orchestra, the Nashville Chamber Orchestra and the San Francisco Bach Choir. Joanna is an active chamber musician, touring with Mirable, American Baroque, Bimbetta, Musica Pacifica and The Streicher Trio, all based in the San Francisco Bay Area where she resides. She was named runner-up in the 2000 EMA/Dorian Competition for her recording of the Jean Zewalt Triemer cello sonatas and has recorded on the Dorian and Eclectra labels.\n\nKatherine Shao, harpsichordist and writer/composer, has performed with many of California' finest classical ensembles, including the New Century Chamber Orchestra, Magnificat, and the San Francisco Symphony. A Master's Degree recipient from the University of Indiana's School of Music, she also works frequently in the contemporary music realm, and has incorporated new music and performance art elements in many of her endeavors, including the production of her unique work, The Path to the New Music, a radio drama about the composer Anton von Webern, for which she was the author and executive producer. She is the managing director of the award-winning ensemble, American Baroque, and appears on numerous recordings. In addition to her creative endeavors, Ms. Shao is a senior manager at a local software company, and takes care of her two young children." .

During his expanding concert activities he had the great fortune to meet artists such as Yehudi Menuhin, Ida Haendel, Denes Zsigmondy, Ulf Holscher, neeme Jarvi, and August Everding. Rudens was invited to perform for former US President Bill Clinton at the ceremony of the German \"Festakt\" in parliament during Mr. Clinton's visit to Berlin in October of 2002. In the same month Rudens made a successful tour of Spain.\n\nHis first CD, recorded with Pianist Olaf Dressler, was released in September of 2001. Radio and TV stations in Britain, France, Spain, Albania, Germany, and the United States of America have extended invitations to Rudens to appear.\n\nRudens Turku founded in 1999 the \"Starnberger Musiktage\" (Bavaria), which has taken place annually ever since. He is also the Assistant Professor at the Luzern/Vitznau, annual Master Courses at Vierwaldstadter See in Switzerland. In August 2000 he gave his debut at the Festival of Mecklenburg Vorpommern in Northern Germany. The Summer Music Academy in Thuringen Germany appointed him as artistic director in 2005 and in the same year he had his debut in Australia as well as at the Rhein Sieg Kammermusic Festival. Invitations for the 2005-06 season bring Rudens to New York, Houston, Chicago, Seattle, and many European cities and festivals including the Mecklenburg Vorpommern Musikfestival, Moselwochen Festival and the Chursachsische Mozart Festival.\n" .

Winter Moon remained in the top 50 on the New Age Reporter charts throughout 2005, and was nominated by broadcasters in four categories for the NAR Lifestyle Music Awards including Album of the Year and Best New Artist.\n\nAs much as Rhonda Lorence's compositions are an expression of her artistry as a violist, they are also about her creative abilities as a sound engineer and producer. Lorence recorded and mastered every track on Winter Moon, blending the vocals of Angela Sterling Forest with synthesizers, while playing all the accompanying live strings.\n\nMany of the influences that prevail on the Winter Moon CD are also a result of Lorence's 25 year performance career which included tours of Japan and Korea with the Mantovanni Orchestra; as well as a stint as principal violist for the Naples (FL) Orchestra; performances with the Russian Ballet Orchestra and Tampa Bay Opera; and numerous show performances with legends such as Tony Bennett, Dionne Warwick, Henry Mancini and Burt Bacharach. Crossing cultures has always appealed to Lorence, in fact, and threads of Celtic and Moroccan music can be heard in her work as well, along with Asian and Eastern European influences.\n\nWhen asked about her creative process, Lorence acknowledges an intentional spiritual aim. \"I think the most important thing is that the music inspires someone to fully listen, feel, and really experience the complexity of emotions embedded within it.\"" .

Using a combination of medieval, Renaissance, Celtic music, and American folk, Music for Healing promotes relaxation and reduces anxiety during stressful hospital stays and procedures. Patients and staff experience the power of music to calm and soothe in a noisy, high-anxiety environment.\n\nMusic for Healing began in 1999 at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Oakland, CA. Organization founders Eileen Hadidian and Natalie Cox offered a pilot program to play on the surgery, medical and intensive care floors, as well as in the hospital lobby. It's a non-profit organization and is supported by grants and donations, which provide funding to bring healing music to local hospitals. All donations are tax-deductible.\n\nEileen Hadidian has appeared in concert throughout the Western United States. She was the founder and artistic director of Hausmusik, an early music concert series in Albany, CA. Her involvement with music for healing grew out of her own experience with breast cancer, in 1994 and again in 1997. She used music for her own healing, and began to play for other cancer patients. She has been exploring ways in which music can be used to help soothe critically and chronically ill people.\n\nNatalie Cox is principal harpist with the Oakland East Bay Symphony and performs throughout the Bay Area as a chamber musician as well as for TV and film. Her earliest public appearances were for people in informal settings, at fairs and in hospitals. She continues this work, believing fully that there are more places for live music than on stage." .

He has worked with many cutting edge artists such as Quincy Jones, Paul Simon, Isao Tomita, Kitaro, Stanley Clark, Allan Holdsworth and Stevie Wonder. Christopher's pioneering work with the Synclavier, a very sophisticated digital synthesis computer, culminated with his contribution to the multi-platinum album \"Bad\" by Michael Jackson. Christopher plays guitar, Ztar, keyboards, synthesizers and devices.\n\nChristopher eventually gravitated away from pop music when his long time interest in the nature of the human mind and spirit became full time research. Christopher's current work involves the creation of music and sound improvisations that can transport the listener to new realms of experience. Christopher sensed that high technology combined with knowledge of the human mind and spirit can potentially elevate the human consciousness.\n\n\"It is crucial towards this goal, to create performances that are influenced first by the immediate environment, which then act as a departure point to transport the audience to another time and place,\" says Christopher.\n\nIn this new endeavor, Currell is joined by world renowned vocalist Beth Quist, who recently finished a two year stint as the lead vocalist in the Cirque Du Soleil production of KA at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Beth is also a member of Bobby McFerrin's Voicestra project. Beth is very highly skilled with many forms of singing including Middle Eastern and Indian music. Beth plays hammered dulcimer, flute, 12 string acoustic guitar, Doumbek, Zils, Daff, Riqq, various percussion, piano (she started playing at 2 years old) and synthesizers. She is also a trained dancer and has a true four octave soprano voice.\n\nIn addition to many world instruments, Iishwish utilizes advanced computer synthesis designed specifically to manipulate, and alter audio and visual vibrations in real-time. The combined influence of the audience, the environment and the intent of Ishwish at the moment, result in every performance being different and unique.\n\n\"May peace prevail on earth,\" says Ishwish." .

With her roots in classical and folk music, training in vocal traditions from several corners of the globe, and an ear for innovation, Artemis puts electronic music's limitless spectrum to bold use. Her style ranges from sparse to sparkling to richly symphonic, blending elements of trip-hop, downtempo, drum and bass, breakbeats, and electro-pop to create a potent fusion set ablaze with siren vocals as riveting as they are intimate.\n\nArtemis is joined by fellow members of electronic artist collective RTFM for live performances featuring Artemis on vocals, flutes and theremin, Keith Crusher on bass, programming and live effects, Daniel Berkman on handsonic percussion, African kora, keys and guitar, and Cliff Tune on V-drums. Ben Davis (reFRACTion) rounds out the show with creative and engaging lighting/video and set design. Artemis's sibylline lyrical vision and a posse of extraordinary musicians and artists of sound and light weld a hypnotic synergy, offering the audience an inspiring aural and visual journey.\n\nArtemis' releases Gravity (2005) and Undone (2001) have garnered praise and press in publications from the New York Times to Remix, Electronic Musician, and Keyboard magazines. She is a top seller on online music label Magnatune's roster, and has recently been signed to Cyberset, a new-edge label focused on progressive and forward thinking music in the San Francisco Bay Area. Her music receives airplay in the U.S. and internationally, has been licensed for television, video and compilations, and she has recorded and collaborated with producers worldwide including Banco de Gaia's Toby Marks and former Duran Duran manager Paul Berrow.

Together, the pair crafts tuneful, friendly songs with subtle but effective arrangements, dynamic and graceful and memorable.\n\nNow, Braun is back with her fifth CD, NOW & ZEN, and on these fourteen tracks Braun shows an even greater depth and maturity. NOW & ZEN expands on her penchant for jazzed up, funk-tinged pop, and shows this gifted songstress taking bold steps on her soulful journey into self-exploration. The torch song, \"Move the Clouds,\" is evocative and inspirational, anchored by easy lounge piano and a melody as delicate as flower petals. The groovy \"J'en Suis Desolee\" showcases Braun's confident rap, surprising and rocking with an edgy explosion of homegirl verve.\n\nArtsy and intellectual, tuneful and savvy, Norine Braun will zing to the heart of any listener. Norine Braun's repertoire ranges from ethereal, reflective moods to sizzling bluesy rock that test the limit of popular music. She is inspired by the struggle to find meaning in the human experience. Her lyrics, although provocative, do not lose touch with her whimsical nature." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/stellamara> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Stellamara originated in 1994 creating evocative soundscapes that are now considered a new model in contemporary world music. At its core is vocalist/producer Sonja Drakulich and multi- instrumentalist Gari Hegedus. Their music incorporates medieval European, Persian, Arabic, Indian, Turkish and Balkan with subtle electronic textures. The result is a sublime new level of mystery, beauty and depth.\n\nSonja Drakulich was introduced to Eastern European singing as a teenager and began performing Balkan, Medieval Music and her own compositions at the age of 18. Being of Serbian and Hungarian decent, discovering the songs of Eastern Europe was for her a homecoming. Her continuous interest and study ranges from Medieval European and Persian voice to Turkish, Arabic and Greek and Balkan singing.\n\nShe has toured extensively with both Bulgarian and Turkish Ensembles and has produced and engineered several recordings. She is the producer of Stellamara and performs with the ensemble as the lead vocalist, percussionist and hammered dulcimer player. Sonja spends much of her time focusing on the devotional aspect of song and carries with her a passionate and rhythmic style graced with the delicate ornamentations of Eastern melody.\n\nGari Hegedus began devoting his life to music 25 years ago with the study of Early European, Celtic and Bretagne music. From there he was led east into the intense practice and performance of Turkish classical and Mevlevi ceremonial music.\n\nGari's repertoire and playing styles span outward from Turkey into Greece and the Arab lands as well as to Iran and India. His main instruments are the oud, violin and saz yet his talent is expressed on many other instruments including the mandocello, sarod and setar.\n\nAs a composer and musician, Gari utilizes the various Eastern modal systems called Maqam and has developed the art of improvisation (Taqsim) to a soulful level for which he has become highly recognized.\n\nOn stage and in the studio, Stellamara incorporates the talents of percussionists Tobias Roberson and Susu Pampanin, along with upright Bassist Miles Jay.\n\nTheir tapestry of sound is complemented with the custom sound design of Christofer K. Original, atmospheric sounds and sonic backdrops are created from mostly their own acoustic sources, such as the yayli tanbur, viola and wind instruments such as the Ney and Zurna. The result of this creation is a sublime new level of mystery, Beauty and depth." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/psychetropic> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Todd Fletcher (the musician behind Psychetropic) has been creating electronic music since 1983, using an Apple IIe computer, inspired primarily by the music of Klaus Schulze and Brian Eno. From the beginning his music emphasized the union of sound design with melody and rythm to create a complete sound matrix.\n\nFletcher's first releases were cassettes for the Poison Plant label, including a track on the LP compilation Charmed. In 1994 he self-released the CD Byzantium, inspired by a growing fascination with Middle Eastern music. Following in 1995 was an excursion into desert ambience, Star, on the Amplexus sub-label Arya. In 1996 Fletcher appeared on two compilations CD's, Twilight Earth II (Timebase) and Soundscape Gallery I (Lektronic Soundscapes)\n\nThe microrelease label debuted in 2001 with two releases. Arcane Energies combines the desert atmospheres of Star with the dense rythmic interplay of Byzantium. 23 introduced Fletcher's side-project Psychetropic, exploring a techno/Berlin School sound.\n\nFletcher's interest in sound design as an integral aspect of music continues to deepen. Currently producing music entirely on computer, he uses numerous software tools to create singular sound atmospheres condusive to dreaming and reflection." .

Born and bred in New York's Lower East Side, Nova Express' creative song writing force is generated by founding members Mike Dee-Bass & Vocals (New York) and Eric Robel-Drums (Baltimore, MD), based on the concept of bringing together fast high-energy punk with the twin guitar assault of Motor City Rock-n-Roll. Supported by long-time member David Acampora-Rhythm guitar (L.A.), original lead guitarist Danny Mackane (NY), and more recently Suke of Snuka fame (NY) bringing in high caliber guitar work, the result is pure rock and roll: fast and ferocious, hard, heavy and loud.\n\nWatch Nova Express's video of their song \"Gimme Some More.\" You can view or download the entire quicktime movie.\n\nTo date, NE have been featured on a variety of national and international Indie labels such as Devil Doll, TeePee/Victory, Rue Morgue, Vicious Kitten, Myrmecoleo and now Magnatune! An upcoming Reptilian Records comp featuring Nova Express covering a Dead Boys song is also slated. Being well reviewed from such magazines as Carbon 14, Punk ! magazine, L.A. Weekly, Screech Magazine and Toxic Flyer have helped gather the attention Nova Express has gained to pull off packed shows wherever they play. Sal Canzonieri of Electric Frankenstein says \"Nova Express is the best of the new breed of Rock-n-Rollers.\"\n\nNE has toured up and down the east and west coast in such cities as NY, Philadelphia, Baltimore, DC, Columbus, LA, SF, and SD with other bands such as: Candy Snatchers, Electric Frankenstein, Zeke, The Bullys, Street Walkin' Cheetahs, Texas Terri and The Black Halos. All with great audience reception. 11 songs, recorded at the famous LoHo Studios in New Yorks' Lower East Side by Engineer Joe Hogan, is the result of the bands' best to date entitled \"Gimme Some\" available here in downloadable form." .

They are a group of musicians who work together, as their name implies, without a director.\n\nTheir recent release Cancionero - Music for the Spanish Court 1470 - 1520, won a CMA / WQXR Record Award, was chosen as a Critics Choice Record of the Year by Gramophone Magazine and was nominated for a Grammy. A L'Estampida, one of their most popular recordings, is of Medieval Dance Music from the 13th and 14th centuries.\n\nThe highly successful 12 years since its formation have taken The Dufay Collective on tours throughout most of Europe as well as further afield. They have toured extensively in the Middle East, India, Hong Kong, Australia, the US and Latin America. At home The Dufay Collective has appeared in numerous concert series and festivals around the country, and has given sell-out concerts at London's main concert halls.\n\nHighlights of recent years have included performances in the monastery of Montserrat, Early Music Network tours in Holland, Norway and the UK, the Tallinn Festival in Estonia, the Festival de Fes in Morocco, and regular concerts in Spain. A return to Australia as part of the Sydney Festival was highly successful, as was a series of concerts in Singapore. At home they continue their association with Dartington Summer School, the year 2000 being their eighth as tutors. In May 2000 the Dufays feature live on BBC2's 'Perfect Day' broadcast and planned is a collaboration with The Orlando Consort and the Richard Alston Dance Company.\n\nThe group has broadcast on many radio and TV networks around the world as well as working on a number of TV and film projects, including Zeffirelli's feature film Hamlet. Their CD's have all met with critical acclaim, releases for Chandos Records including a range of repertoire from medieval Europe, the early Spanish renaissance and popular music from 17th century England." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/wamsley> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Trip credits the fateful day early in 1982 when he heard \"Silly Love Songs\" by Wings as the day he decided that music was for him. He would often accompany his band-director father to area music stores where he would see bass guitars. The young Trip thought basses were, \"...big guitars for dumb people...\". (We've learned to appreciate Trip's dry sense of humor...) Trip's school had a bass that was not being used, so he brought it home and learned to play \"Summer Nights\" from the movie \"Grease\". With his first song under his belt and some new-found confidence, Trip set out to make music.\n\nTrip studied with Michael Manring in 1991 and 1992, which was an experience Trip says that consisted of scathing invective and brutal honesty. Trip credits Michael with the phrase \"...be deep wide awake and slow...\".\n\nTrip's playing takes on both the rhythmic bass and melodic lead roles, harmonics and overtones are flung about effortlessly. Right hand, left hand, all ten fingers, tuning keys and every ounce of potential is used to bring forth music from his finely crafted instruments. Musicains will appreciate his creative use of both fretted and fretless basses, special effects and detuners. Trip is the introduction to the bass guitar as a complete orchestra.\n\n\"It's Better This Way\" is Trip's newest and most focused work. Â It was recorded in Nashville with producer Todd Bragg (Caedmon's Call). Â It is a simple, yet lush instrumental album that will remind you of ***what*** beautiful music is supposed to sound like.\n\nTrip performs solo concerts all over the world, plays in the art rock band Atomic Opera, and hangs out with his wife Saran and son Xander at his house in Louisiana." .

She holds a Bachelors Degree in harpsichord performance from the Peabody Conservatory of Music and a Masters Degree in historical performance in harpsichord from Oberlin Conservatory. It was at Amsterdam's Sweelinck Conservatorium that she earned an advanced degree in harpsichord performance and later studied with Gustav Leonhardt, whom she praises as much for his philosopy of music as she does his musicianship. (\"His emphasis was never on technique, but on what was behind the music.\")\n\nMs. Kim maintains an highly active international touring calender with numerous historical instrument ensembles including Southern California Chamber Orchestra, Pierce Baroque Dance Company, the Oberlin Baroque Orchestra, the Indiana Baroque Orchestra, the Los Angeles Baroque Orchestra, San Luis Obispo Mozart Festival Period Ensemble, Brandywine Baroque, Musica Angelica, and Music's ReCreation. She performed with American Baroque at the Library of congress in 2001 and has performed with her principal group, Mirable, in the 2002 Bloomington Early Music Festival as well as on both the 2003/2004 San Francisco Early Music Society and the San Jose Chamber Music Society series.\n\nIn 2006, Ms. Kim was awarded a grant by the Peninsula Council for the Arts to produce a recording of solo keyboard works and recently inaugurated the Brisbane Concert Series with a sold-out solo performance. In January 2005, she performed on tour in Hawaii and returned to solo with the San Francisco Symphony in a series of performances of Bach's Fifth Brandenburg Concerto. Upcoming engagements include solo and chamber music performances in the Bay Area and in San Diego, as well as in the 2005 Assisi Summer Festival in Italy.\n" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/janover> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Jamie Janover is recognized as a true innovator on the hammered dulcimer. As the 2002 national hammered dulcimer champion, Jamie is reinventing the way hammered dulcimer used by being the leading purveyor of a new style called dulcitronica!\n\nIntricately layered soundscapes evolve from dense textural grooves to spacious ethereal ambience using a custom hammered dulcimer, miniature drum kit and the magic of digital technology. Jamie brings new direction to the hammered dulcimer by applying diverse percussive techniques drawn from some of the other instruments he plays: drums, mini-kit, multi-percussion, tabla, congas, bongos, timbales, and udu. His background as a drummer gives him a totally different approach to the hammered dulcimer than traditional players. His style is characterized by a symbiotic interplay between rhythm and melody, laying down deep intricate grooves and not being afraid to take the listener into new realms of the timbral universe.\n\nSince moving to Boulder, Colorado in 1995, Jamie has played with a diverse group of bands including, ZILLA, Zuvuya, The Motet, The Theory Of Everything, Vibe Squad, The Zambiland Orchestra, Chupacabra, and his own band, Jamie Janover and the Realms Ensemble, among many others.\n\nJamie is also a veteran of hundreds of live guest appearances having performed with Phish, Stanley Jordan, Bela Fleck, The String Cheese Incident , Leftover Salmon, Keller Williams, The Jazz Mandolin Project, Sector 9, The Slip, Govt Mule, Tony Furtado, Darol Anger, Mike Marshall, Warren Haynes, Sam Bush, Derrek Trucks, Future Man, Stanton Moore, members of the Rebirth Brass Band, The Dead, Big Head Todd and the Monsters and The Yonder Mountain String Band, among many others.\n\nJamie has appeared on over 30 commercial CD releases including recordings by The String Cheese Incident, G. Love and Special Sauce, Keller Williams, Garaj Mahal, Shanti Groove, Chupacabra and Stephen Halpern. He has performed at venues and festivals across the country including the Telluride Bluegrass Festival, High Sierra Music Festival, N.W. Festival of Jazz and Wine, Red Rocks Amphitheater, Tippitina's in New Orleans and The Great American Music Hall in San Francisco.\n\nA world traveler, Jamie has played not just in the U.S. and Canada, but also in Africa (for the Masai of Kenya), India and Australia. His live performances have included everything from solo hammered dulcimer concerts, to playing in bands on drum kit, percussion, hammered dulcimer or didjeridoo. Jamie also does hammered dulcimer workshops, school assemblies, weddings and accompanies dance and theater performances.\n\nJamie Janover's music is diverse in scope and so have been the ways in which it has been used. Janover's music has been used for television and video soundtracks, theater and dance performances, meditation practices and massage videos. His work has been treated in several nationally circulated publications including Dirty Linen, Relix, Dulcimer Player News, and Mountain Freak and has been featured on the NPR radio programs \"All Things Considered\" and \"New Sounds\".\n\nAn incredible new step in Jamie's creative output was his invention of the \"Realms Mobile\", which is a musical vehicle! The \"Realms Mobile\" is a recumbent tricycle, attached to which is a mini-simulated drumkit. This enables Jamie to play drums with both hands and pedal around at the same time! He brings it out at large festivals including Burning Man.\n\nWith each new project, new album, new band, new instrument comes another step in the continued evolution of Jamie's creative process. He continues to cross-pollinate both genres and mediums in his continual exploration into the infinite realms of the creative process. Perhaps best known for his musical abilities, Jamie is also a professional photographer. Janover is a truly multi-talented and totally unique artist in the broadest sense of the term.\n\nJanover plays hammered dulcimer duets with Michael Masley on \"All Strings Considered\"." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/solace> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Solace's music is produced with a story in mind, a theme, as a book without words, including dialogue between the characters (instruments), and story development in chapters (songs).\n\nAll recordings are produced in a state of the art, fully automated digital studio, as quality recording is as important as the songs themselves.\n\nThe songs must have meaning, passion and depth, and must sound clear and clean, as if the musicians were right there with you. Note: Magnatune artist Tim Rayborn is a member of the Solace Live project, and Charlie Pecot of Falik performs on some of the Solace CDs.\n\nJeremiah M. Soto describes his musical endeavors \"Solace,\" meaning comfort. Born November 4th 1968, in Loma Linda California, to Ismael and Erlinda Soto; Jeremiah's first experience with music was sitting silently near his sisters bedroom door curiously listening to The Beatles' Sergeant Peppers... or David Bowies Low. Ever since that early experience, Jeremiah showed an interest in music - especially drums.\n\nAfter teaching himself basic piano technique, Jeremiah started writing music at the age of 14. In 1990, he began formal studies in Music Theory and Piano at Crafton Hills College, and graduated with an Associate of Arts degree in 1992.\n\nIn 1992, he and lifetime musical partner Dann Torres formed the group Eventide. They recruited the talents of Laura Grissom on bass and Julie Blodgett on vocals. Influenced by bands like Dead Can Dance, Cocteau Twins, and various classical composers, Eventide experimented with fusing Medieval and Middle Eastern music. In the process, Jeremiah realized his fascination and talent for Middle Eastern drum rhythms. To better his knowledge, Jeremiah attended classes in Frame Drum, Conga, and African polyrhythms by world-renowned percussionist Ronnie Engle. Unfortunately, after several releases on various compilations and countless live performances, Eventide disbanded in February 1995.\n\nIn November of 1995, after attending countless Middle Eastern Dance conventions and parties, Jeremiah felt inspired and confident enough to release his debut recording Rhythm Of The Dance (eve 01) and Solace was born. At the same time, Jeremiah resurrected the old name Eventide to serve as a foundation name for his independent record label, now known as Eventide Music Productions.\n\nIn the early part of 1996, Jeremiah reunited with old pals Dann Torres and Laura Grissom to collaborate on a short lived side project, Still. Their efforts were directed to record a CD themed at combining minimal guitar with Middle Eastern rhythms. In mid 1996, Thinnerweb (eve 02) became the second release on Eventide Music Productions.\n\nSoon after the release of Thinnerweb, Jeremiah started work on his second Solace release. In August of 1997 Sha'waza (eve 03) came in to the world; catapulting Jeremiah's music and popularity to the forefront of the Middle-Eastern Dance Music genre. In 1998, Sha'waza was nominated for a IAMED Award for best Belly Dancing music.\n\nHot on the heels of the Sha'waza nomination, Jeremiah began work on his next endeavor. The Gathering Season (eve 04) was released in late 1998. Soon after completion of The Gathering Season, Jeremiah was introduced to master dumbek player Souhail Kaspar. From that point on, Jeremiah's fascination and skill with Arabic drumming became more refined, as he embraced the Classical Arabic Style. In addition to accompanying Souhail at parties, Jeremiah has performed with the UCLA Mid East Ensemble, and as a back up percussionist for Souhail for Sinbad, a European released CGI movie.\n\nIn June 1999, Jeremiah returned to the studio to explore the vast new knowledge of rhythm arrangements taught to him by his new mentor and friend, Souhail Kaspar. With the help of Harry Saroyan, Alex Spurkel, Lydia Fortner, Jim Karagozian, Dann Torres, Steven Flynn, and the troup Yogini Kundalini; Jeremiah was able to produce one of his best works to date, Ahsas (eve 05). The project would not have been complete without the help of Ansuya's contribution to the CD cover, giving Ahsas its signature beauty. Released on March 24th, Ahsas' debut at Rakkasah 2000 and was an instant success that promised to out sell Sha'waza.\n\nJeremiah hopes to break the confines of typical Middle Eastern Dance Music & inspire others through his unique compositional style and love of Arabic rhythms and music. Solace music is not just great belly dancing music; it is a journey into the heart and mind, a journey where others fear to tread." .

Oberlin is in Ohio, near Cleveland, and not much else.\n\nOne day, a small yet innovative company called Propellerheads came up with a stellar piece of music software called Reason which completely changed Kirsch's approach to music, allowing him to condense a large studio's worth of equipment onto his desktop computer. He started tooling around with the software and got very inspired. So much, that he made an album, called General Fuzz(2002).\n\nA few years later, Kirsch discovered a new piece of software called Live, created by Ableton. This software integrated a musical technology called VST, which allowed him use all sorts of new virtual instruments. Live also has sophisticated digital audio recording capabilities, which meant he could start having talented friends come over and work on recordings collaboratively.\n\nKirsch finished up Messy's Place just in time for Burning Man 2005, where he gave 500 copies of it to unsuspecting people. In the months that followed, he received a flood of emails from people, praising it, and decided to do a more formal release for the album." .

Together, they make a uniquely sophisticated dream pop with a big, but intensely graceful sound.\n\nIn his native Japan, Toshio Kamei is known as a composer who wrote numerous best selling songs (including two chart toppers) for various artists. Starting his career in music as a violinist, he has worked extensively as a vocalist, composer, guitarist, and violinist. His first solo album was Body which was released from Sony Japan, and he followed this up with a release as part of the group known as Cancamay.\n\nChieko started her working life in the world of film and has produced numerous documentaries and dramas, as a screenplay for a drama series based on the life of a legendary Japanese violinist. Her works have collected prizes in Japan, such as with the Galaxy award, ACC award and Dentsu award.\n\nFloating World was the first self-produced Yongen album which was released from their own label, Igi, in the UK. Their second album, Moonrise was initially a Japanese release, with the \"Sunflower\" track featured in the Shiseido Ville Franche TV campaign. In 2002, they produced the debut album Relationship for Taro, which was released from Polystar Japan in 2003.\n\nThe band's name comes from the Japenese word for the fourth string, which is the warmest, strongest string on a violin. Chieko and Toshio chose the name when they realized one day how each of their lives had been shaped the violin and those who play it." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/kitka> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Kitka is a professional women's vocal ensemble dedicated to producing concerts, recordings, and educational programs that develop new audiences for music rooted in Eastern European women's vocal traditions. Kitka also strives to expand the boundaries of this music as an expressive art form.\n\nOur mission is accomplished through a busy itinerary of live performances, including an Oakland-based home concert series; state, regional, national, and international touring programs; community outreach activities and workshops; in-school programs; radio broadcasts; recording projects; master artist residencies; commissioning programs; and adventuresome collaborations.\n\nHistory\n\nNow approaching its 25th Anniversary season, Kitka was founded in 1979 as an offshoot of the Westwind International Folk Ensemble. Kitka began as a grassroots group of amateur singers from diverse ethnic and musical backgrounds who met regularly to share their passion for the stunning dissonances, asymmetric rhythms, intricate ornamentation, lush harmonies, and resonant strength of Eastern European women's vocal music. Under the artistic direction of vocalist, composer, and conductor Bon Brown Singer from 1981 to 1996, Kitka blossomed into a refined professional ensemble earning international renown for its artistry, versatility, and mastery of the demanding techniques of Balkan and Slavic vocal styling.\n\nUnder the co-direction of long-time ensemble members Shira Cion, Juliana Graffagna, and Janet Kutulas since 1997, Kitka has grown to earn recognition from the National Endowment for the Arts, National Public Radio, and Chorus America as one of this country's premier vocal ensembles. In addition, many Eastern European musical authorities have come to consider Kitka the foremost interpreter of Balkan and Slavic Choral repertoire working in the United States. In June of 2002, Kitka performed as \"international guests of honor\" at the 50th Anniversary Jubilee concert of the world-renowned Bulgarian Women's Choir Le Mystere des Voix Bulgares at the Bulgarian National Palace of Culture in Sofia, Bulgaria.\n\nKitka has deep ties to Eastern Europe. In 1986, the group performed at the Illinden Festival in Bitola, Macedonia. In 1991 Kitka members traveled to Bulgaria as part of a delegation of America's finest Balkan singers, led by the Seattle vocalist and choral director Mary Sherhart and the Varna, Bulgaria-based master vocalist Vesela Illieva. This group of singers became the first non-indigenous ensemble to be invited to perform at the closing ceremonies of the 1991 Koprivshtitsa National Festival of Bulgarian Folklore. This historic performance was broadcast twice throughout Europe by Bulgarian National Television. In recent years, Kitka has hosted master artist residencies and collaborative concerts in Oakland, CA with some of the finest choral directors and folk singers from Bulgaria, Macedonia, Russia, Georgia, Ukraine, Greece, Belarus, and Turkey. KITKA's singers have also conducted independent field research in Bulgaria, Macedonia, Russia, Former Yugoslavia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Hungary, as well as in Balkan and Slavic communities throughout America." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/robert_rich> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "With over two dozen albums under his belt, Robert Rich has helped define the genres of ambient and dark-ambient music, yet his work remains hard to categorize. Part of his unique sound comes from using home-made acoustic and electronic instruments, as well as microtonal tunings, computer-based signal processing, chaotic systems, and feedback networks. Rich began building his own analog synthesizers in 1976 when he was 13 years old, and he later studied for a year at Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA).\n\nRich released his first album, Sunyata, in 1982. Most of his subsequent recordings came out in Europe until 1989, when Rich began a string of critically acclaimed releases for Fathom/Hearts of Space, including Rainforest (1989), Gaudi (1991), Propagation (1994) and Seven Veils (1998). His two collaborations with Steve Roach, Strata (1990), and Soma (1992), both charted for several months on Billboard. Other respected collaborations include Stalker (1995 with B. Lustmord), Fissures (1997 with Alio Die) and Outpost (2002 with Ian Boddy.) Rich's contributions to multi-artist compilations have been collected on his solo albums A Troubled Resting Place (1996) and Below Zero (1998). He also records with his group, Amoeba, exploring atmospheric songcraft on their CDs Watchful (1997) and Pivot (2000). Live albums such as Calling Down the Sky (2004) and 3-CD Humidity (2000) document the unique improvised flow of his recent performances.\n\nRich has performed in caves, cathedrals, planetaria, art galleries and concert halls throughout Europe and North America. His all-night \"Sleep Concerts,\" first performed in 1982, became legendary in the San Francisco area. In 1996 he revived his all-night concert format, playing Sleep Concerts for live and radio audiences across the U.S. during a three month tour. In 2001 Rich released the 7 hour DVD Somnium, a studio distillation of the Sleep Concert experience, possibly the longest continuous piece of music ever released.\n\nRich has designed sounds for television and film scores, including the films Pitch Black, Crazy Beautiful, Behind Enemy Lines and others. His musical score graces Yahia Mehamdi's documentary on worker's compensation, Thank You for your Patience. Rich has worked closely with electronic instrument manufacturers, and his sound design fills the preset libraries of Emu's Proteus 3 and Morpheus, Seer Systems' Reality, sampling disks Things that Go Bump in the Night, ACID Loop Library Liquid Planet, and the TimewARP2600 soft-synth by WayOutWare. Rich has written software for composers who work in just intonation, and he helped develop the MIDI microtuning specification, which was accepted as an industry standard. As mastering engineer, he has applied his ear to dozens of albums, and his studio was featured twice in Keyboard Magazine." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/zilla> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Zilla is a Colorado based trio of musicians with the live musical experience in mind. A 100 percent improvised creation, each Zilla concert proves to be a completely unique occurrence, with even the band members having no idea where the music will take them on any given night. Relying on their ability to listen to one another to create a hyper-focused form of live electronic dance music, Zilla is dedicated to spreading their rare breed of beats, bass, and \"uncontrollable musical fury,\" and keeps up an incredibly active live performance schedule. Their goal is that each performance reflect what live music should be all about: spontaneity, flow, groove, and a damn good dance party.\n\nZilla is comprised of three seasoned musicians: Michael Travis, Jamie Janover and Aaron Holstein.\n\nZilla's constant focus is to create a whole, complete sound devoid of fragmentation, tangential wandering solos, and other characteristics that plaque improvisational music today. The music strives to serve all those participating, including the audience. No one in the band has any idea what is going to happen a nanosecond ahead of time; they rely on their instincts and musical history together to create a sound that rarely strays from its intended direction. The collective whole is truly the dominant force in this band.\n\nThe music itself is a plethora of grooves, beats and highly percussive breaks, which cause the listener to become engulfed within the sonic vortex of sounds encompassing them. From down-tempo to jungle, from trip-hop to break-beat and trance the band plays on pure emotion, so each night is different and varied, and no song is ever the same.\n\nZilla is about being as aware as humanly possible in the moment. The band plays, the crowd reacts, the band reacts and so on and so on. A cyclical paradigm is created in which everyone plays a part. A whole new form of tension-release music has been created in which the music never has to resolve itself in order to sustain the mood. It merely adapts, evolves.\n\nIt's been said that Zilla is the ultimate live experience - future music. The music plays the band, and not the other way around. Zilla is currently touring in support of their latest CD release, Egg. Their infectious energy has crowds from North America to Japan dancing up a storm to a completely new brand of live musical experience.\n\nMusician Bios\n\nMichael Travis (drums, percussion, keyboards, sampler, mallet Kat) has spent over a decade as the driving percussive force in the nationally popular band, The String Cheese Incident. Travis continues to be an innovator of improvisational drumming, managing to play hand percussion and melodies while simultaneously keeping incredible time with the kit.\n\nAaron Holstein (bass, keyboards, sampler, vocals/vocoder/beatbox) has had a long and lush musical history, playing guitar with bands such as Boogie Shoes and VibeSquad. Holstein's progression has transformed him from the notion of a typical guitar/bass player, to an applauded adapter leaving behind the traditional notions of what it is to âjamâ with a guitar or bass. In the process, he has focused on bass and keyboards and has decided to leave the guitar at home in order to more fully serve the Zilla concept/sound.\n\nJamie Janover (hammered dulcimer, Mini-kit, electric kalimba, mini-sitar, sampler, percussion, tamboura, tongue drum, water) is a world-renowned hammered dulcimer innovator whose long list of band credits is more than impressive. Winner of the 2002 national hammered dulcimer championships, Janover continues to expand the limits of all his instruments by creating a fusion between their timeless sounds and the pertinent call of today's modern dance scene." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/cary> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Cary Norsworthy's favorite musical genre is downtempo, but she's adept at making all sorts of compilations. Her Magnatune series of mixes began with Downtempo Chill in the spring of 2005?a release that resulted in podcasters all over the world discovering and playing Magnatune artists.\n\nCary was drawn to Magnatune because \"the variety and quality of the music is so great, and I'm really impressed with how well they treat their artists. It's fantastic to see musicians getting an equal share of every sale?no one else is doing that.\"\n\nSince then, she's edited several popular compilations, combining tracks from a wide range of Magnatune artists to create a chilled-out mood. With deep, slow grooves that are sometimes jazzy, sometimes trip-hoppy, but always tranquil and soothing, Downtempo Chill and Downtempo Chill 2 take the edge off faster than a dry martini with their airy modernism and sophisticated grace. They feature an array of best-selling Magnatune artists including Curl, Cargo Cult, Drop Trio, Four Stones, and many more.\n\nAfter Dinner Lounge is a chilled out melange of tracks that range from downtempo to world grooves with an occasional hint of Classical. \"I wanted to give it a slight Buddha Bar-like feel,\" says Cary. As its title suggests, After Dinner Lounge is the perfect album to put on after dinner and relax with your friends.\n\nEastern Grooves combines lush, laid-back tracks with a Middle-to-Far-East feel, featuring Magnatune artists such as Stellamara, Beth Quist, Cargo Cult, and Shiva in Exile.\n\nBurbling with cool, liquid synths, Power Synths is a sublimely chilled-out yet subtly energetic mix of electronic grooves that each feature powerful, melodic synths?seamlessly merging tracks from fourteen different Magnatune artists.\n\nAlways peddling her musical tastes around the globe, a couple of Cary's playlists were featured in The iPod Playlist Book from Peachpit Press. In addition to her music habit, she's also an artist, and her CD covers feature some of her own photomontage work. While she cites Magnatune as her favorite record label, she also can't resist the following venues for hardcore music acquisition: Amoeba Records (Berkeley, San Francisco), Concerto Records (Amsterdam), Soul Seduction (Vienna), where she was featured in their December 2005 Radio Days broadcast, and gemm.com." .

Its members are Baroque violinist Jeanne Johnson, Baroque cellist Joanna Blendulf, and harpsichordist Yuko Tanaka. Music of the Spheres was a main event at the 2002 Bloomington and Berkeley Early Music Festivals, resulting in several broadcasts on \"Harmonia. \"\n\nWe believe that music exists to captivate the imagination, stir memories, and evoke intensely personal emotions in both listener and performer alike, and we desire to bring a wider audience to classical music through performances which focus on these aspects. We enjoy giving lively, fun and informative performances, and are available for concerts, series, festivals, recordings and advanced master classes.\n\nJeanne Johnson, Baroque violin\nJoanna Blendulf, Baroque cello\nYuko Tanaka, harpsichord\n\nJeanne Johnson is a soloist and chamber musician on both Baroque and modern violin.

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/seldon> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "\nQuite simply, The Seldon Plan makes some of the best laid-back indie rock around. Comprised of members Bobby Landle and Michael Nestor on guitar and vocals, Dave Hirner on bass, and Mike Landavere on percussion, the band is based in Baltimore, Maryland and has spent the last few years cutting two full length albums and taking on an increasingly busy live performance schedule?including shows with The Stills, Matt Pond PA, Now It's Overhead, I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness, Explosions in the Sky, and Jet By Day.\n\nIn 2003 The Seldon Plan released The Living Room EP, which quickly received airplay on commercial and Internet radio stations such as KSCR and SOMAFM. The band's first full length album, the critically acclaimed Making Circles, made its way onto a number of top-record of the year lists, including a selection as one of \"the top 40 releases of 2005 \"by The Big Takeover. The album was recorded with Frank Marchand (Bob Mould, Good Charlotte) and Charlie Pilzer (Ida, All Mighty Senators, The Kennedys). It was also featured on NPR's All Songs Considered.\n\nThe New Album: The Collective Now An exploration of the band's on-again-off-again relationship with pop, The Collective Now was originally meant to be a dance pop record with healthy references to early 80's college radio. What emerged instead was the band's distinctively layerd indie pop sound?searching, modern, nuanced?with noticeable tension between the desire for accessibility and the need for artistic expression. Listeners might hear glimmers of Maritime, The Little Ones, Band of Horses, Earlimart and The Swirlies. But no matter what you hear, you're sure to enjoy this sophomore effort from The Seldon Plan." .

It has received critical acclaim for its \"informed and impassioned music-making\" and is hailed for its \"great clarity\" and \"irresistible energy\". Drawing on a pool of more than sixty world-class musicians from the United States, Europe, and Canada, the ensemble varies in size according to the particular program of each of its concerts.\n\nThe ensemble produces the Sarasa Chamber Music Series in Cambridge and Concord, Massachusetts and summer concerts based in Putney, Vermont. It has toured throughout New England and to Cuba, Ireland, and India.\n\nSarasa was formed in response to a concert played by its founder, Timothy Merton, in the Sing Sing Correctional Facility in 1997, at the urging of a friend. An inmate who heard that first concert remarked, \"When art is well executed, it projects a message that transcends language, culture, and even aesthetic boundaries.\" Sarasa took these words to heart and since then has been bringing high-quality music to those who ordinarily have little access to it. The ensemble has performed in adult and adolescent correctional facilities, homes for the elderly, mental hospitals, and institutions for the disabled.\n\nFor the last several years Sarasa has been working almost exclusively with teenagers in the greater Boston area. Every concert season the group plays more than twelve outreach concerts and facilitates several residency programs in teenage correctional centers. Through these programs Sarasa seeks to address the spiritual and emotional suffering of incarcerated youth and offer them joy, hope and opportunities for healing through self-expression.\n" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/hybris> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Hybris was formed during a cold winter in the city of \"Kiel\", in Northern Germany in 1998. The local musician scene was mostly represented by heavy- and trash-metal bands, but gothic and other dark music styles are quite popular at several clubs and local events. 7 musicians had the dream of creating powerful melancholic music - representing the emotions of the local gothic rock community.\n\nGothic rock has as many facets as other music styles and a poll of 7 different musicians will have at least 14 opinions about the right way. The first try at Hybris ended without any success and only 2 half completed songs. The lack of success led to disharmony and the band came apart.\n\nThose members of the band, who had decided to not give up, were in a difficult spot. Gothic rock musicians are not as common as representives from other music styles and even in the coldness of Northern Germany there won't be so many guitarists with the \"right\" emotions. So they've decided to start an experiment. Instead of working with 7 musicians with very strong emotions about \"the right\" style of gothic music they opened the band for musicians with wider and different experience in different music styles - and due to that a more experimental approach to the right music style.\n\nOne of the new members was Janis Schibalski a former guitarist and songwriter of a glam rock/party-metal band. Despite his changed preferences (more serious, darker music instead of event driven music the differences between him and most of the other members could not be bigger. Hybris was never planned as a project of friends - it was planned as an experiment, a melting pot of emotions, ideas and extremely different individuals. It was a courageous plan with a strong dedication to at least local succes. This led to the band name: Hybris (which means Hubris in English).\n\nHelge Barth (Bass), Anne Kampmann (Backing Vocals) and Thyra Christmann (Keyboards) were the most \"classical\" gothic musicians, Malte Volquardsen (Drums) had several roots in Punk, Folk and other music styles. Bent Maczewski (guitar) was the bands representive of solid rock music, Gerret Goos (Lead Vocals) had several roots in gothic rock and metal and Janis Schibalski (guitars) with his long experience as live musician and songwriter completed the band.\n\nAn era of hot emotions started in the Hybris rehearsal room - conflicts, discussions but the strong will to achive results. Rotten Flowers was the first result of the melting pot process. Based on an old song of Janis, the band managed it to create a symbiosis out of everyone's influences and emotions. A real conjointly-created work and a sum that was more than its parts.\n\nStrife changed to euphoria and the band quickly recorded the song together with \"Final Trust\" to create a demo CD. Helge handed copies of the demo recording to local DJs of Gothic Clubs and Events and --very ungothic-like-- the members of Hybris nervously awaited the first reactions of the audience. The result was much better than expected. Rotten Flowers and also Final Trust were dancable (note: which means dancable for gothic-fans :P) the DJ urged to make clear, that this was really a demo recording of Hybris and some visitors of the event asked \"Which band was it? Never heard it before!\"\n\nMotivated by the first success, Hybris worked on additional material and completed the last song for the first live-gig only days before the event. The impressive Voice of Gerret and the multifaceted gothic-rock of Hybris lead to several gigs in northern Germany and the CD-Recording \"The First Words\" which marked the zenith of the band history.\n\nSuccess ushered strife.\n\nSome members of the band wanted bigger influence to the songwriting and the direction of the music, others wanted to invest more money for the \"Big deal\" and others wanted to concentrate on live events.\n\nAnother cold winter in Northern Germany, and the band fall apart.

The group is flexible in number and at its smallest performs recitals with just one voice and continuo, expanding to perform Handel's Messiah with a total of 16 singers and players.\n\nLa Nuova Musica is equally committed to live performance and the art of recording.

Along with Michael Shotton of Von Groove on drums, Tom Lewis and Gordon Deppe (of 80's innovators The Spoons) layer and lather up the sound with old effects pedals, Kraftwerk-era drum machines, and hall-of-mirrors self-samples that work perfectly with their upbeat sense of retro-space age wonder.\n\nThis mixed hi-fi/lo-fi approach works particularly well on Automatic Ordinary, which finds the band experimenting with its collection of effects and toys more than ever before?a preoccupation that makes this album a treat for the headphone inclined (there's even a song called \"Headphones\"). Deppe has a string of hits behind him?Nova Heart, Romantic Traffic, and Arias & Symphonies?yet his voice is as fresh and buoyant as ever on Automatic Ordinary, as is his kaleidoscope guitar work. Lewis is the former music director and bassist for Fefe Dobson and Amanda Marshall, and his industry know-how and professionalism really shine through on this album; the tracks are tight, polished, and impeccably arranged. Not to mention, Lewis somehow manages coaxes synth-like groans from an old Fender bass while Shotton delivers fast, intricate rhythms in the way that only a drummer with real heavy metal experience can. Melodic and meteoric , the well-crafted songs of Five Star Fall seem always to be rocketing forward toward some better tomorrow. Catch them if you can." .

They have together established a world-wide reputation for the expressive vitality and technical quality of their music-making, and have for many years been amongst Britains leading period instrument ensembles.\n\nThe English Concert promotes its own series of concerts in London and is also in great demand overseas with repertoire ranging from chamber music to opera. In 2002 the focus for the larger-scale work is on J.S.Bachs great religious masterpieces, the St.Matthew Passion and Christmas Oratorio, while the orchestral work includes concerts in The Netherlands, France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Austria and Hungary. In 2001 The English Concert toured a new Jonathan Miller production of Handels great opera Tamerlano as a co-production with the Handel Festival, Halle and Thtre des Champs Elyses, Paris.

Outside Europe The English Concert has toured the USA, South America and Japan within the last two seasons, and will return to Japan and South America in 2003 and to North America in the 2004/05 season.\n\nTrevor Pinnock is recognised as a leading personality in the direction of period-instrument performance and a harpsichord soloist of international reputation.\n\nHaving trained as a chorister at Canterbury Cathedral and as a scholar at the Royal College of Music, Trevor Pinnock formed The English Concert in 1973; since then, his lively and stylish interpretations with this ensemble have set new standards in the field of period performance.\n\nTrevor Pinnock has appeared frequently as a guest conductor with many of the world's leading orchestras, including the Boston, San Francisco and Detroit Symphony orchestras, the St Paul and Los Angeles Chamber orchestras and at the Tanglewood and Mostly Mozart festivals, he became Principal conductor and artistic director of the National Arts Centre Orchestra, Ottawa. He made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1988 with Handel's Giulio Cesare.\n\nThe 1999/2000 season included engagements with the Austro-Hungarian Haydn Orchestra, Mito Chamber Orchestra, Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, tours of the USA and South America with The English Concert, chamber music recitals with Rachel Podger and Jonathan Manson in Japan and duo recitals with Maxim Vengerov in Europe. The 2000/2001 season includes concerts with The English Concert in Japan (Bach St Matthew Passion), Spain (Monteverdi Combattimento), Halle, Paris and London (Handel Tamerlano) and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, among others.\n\nFirmly established as one of the world's foremost harpsichord virtuosi, Trevor Pinnock's solo recordings include Scarlatti Sonatas, Handel's Harpsichord Suites and Bach's Goldberg Variations and complete Partitas. As a soloist he has recorded the Bach Harpsichord Concerti and Haydn's Piano Concerto (Hob.

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/zephyrus> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "The music of Renaissance Europe comes to life in the voices of Zephyrus, the early music ensemble based in Charlottesville. Known throughout the region for its innovative programming and professional caliber, Zephyrus offers several major performances each year and appears locally in churches and at the University of Virginia.\n\nSince its founding in 1991 by director Paul Walker, Zephyrus has devoted itself to bringing the treasures of of Medieval, Renaissance, and early Baroque music to a wider audience. The ensemble's repertoire spans six centuries, from the polyphonic chants of Notre Dame Cathedral to the sacred motets of Tudor England, the madrigals of Renaissance Italy, and the masterworks of the early Baroque. The eighteen-member core group regularly divides into double chorus, quintets, and other smaller ensembles, offering a range of musical textures at every concert. Zephyrus strives for historical accuracy in performance and has enlisted the efforts of early music instrumentalists. The group has collaborated with Baroque flutist Robert Turner of Charlottesville, Medieval fiddle player Nancy Bren Nuzzo of Buffalo, NY, and theorist Scott Horton of Baltimore.\n\nIn the fall of 1997 Zephyrus presented a concert of the \"Coronation Music of James II and Queen Mary of England\" with anthems for voices and strings by Henry Purcell and John Blow. And in the spring of 1998 Zephyrus presented a pair of concerts titled \"The Dawning of Sacred Music in Germany - Exalted Music for Voices and Brass\" with sackbuts and cornetti at the Duke University Chapel in Durham, NC and at St. Paul's Memorial Church in Charlottesville. Other notable concerts have included the Taverner \"Missa Gloria Tibi Trinitas,\" presented both in Charlottesville and at St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington, D.C., the Victoria Requiem and Schuetz Musikalishes Exequien, and the first American performance of the Christmas Oratorio \"In Nativitatem Domini Canticum\" by Marc-Antoine Charpentier.\n\nAlso in the fall of 1997, Zephyrus released its first compact disc, Nativity, a collection of Renaissance motets for Christmas, recorded in the wonderful acoustical ambience of Holy Comforter Catholic Church in Charlottesville on the first weekend of May that year. The CD was produced by Sally Sanford, noted singer-scholar of early music, whom Dr. Walker has engaged to coach the group on several occasions in the past few years and with whom many of the members study voice on a regular basis.\n\nAs part of its educational mission, Zephyrus has presented lecture-recitals at area schools, including Piedmont Virginia Community College, the Tandem School, and Hereford College at the University of Virginia.\n\nZephyrus is led by Dr. Paul Walker, a musician and scholar who has led early music ensembles for the last sixteen years. Dr. Walker holds a Ph.D. in musicology from SUNY Buffalo and a Master's degree in organ performance from the University of Kansas. He has taught at Yale and the University of Chicago, and he now serves as director of the University of Virginia Collegium Musicum, and is on the music faculty of the University of Virginia.\n\nThe singers of Zephyrus come from a wide variety of academic and professional backgrounds, but share a love of chamber singing and a commitment to excellence in performance. Operated solely by its members, Zephyrus relies on tax-deductible contributions from area patrons to assist with its expenses." .

Since its inception, the group's focus has been on exploring the many variations in continuo performance across different baroque styles. Ensemble Mirable is a flexible performing entity, maintaining the ability to change and grow to meet the needs of different scale continuo demands. The members feel that in order to provide an exciting and yet elegant rendition of this repertoire, it is necessary to work within the composer's stylistic framework.\n\nIn 1998, Ensemble Mirable relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area where it continues to maintain an active concert schedule. In the summer of 2000, Ensemble Mirable won honorable mention in the second Dorian Group/Early Music America International Recording Competition for their performance of sonatas by Jean Zewalt Triemer. Goals in the near-term include the performance of cello and continuo works by Triemer, Geminiani, and works by various lesser-known baroque composers. Ultimately, Ensemble Mirable would like to stage larger scale works involving a continuo band, in collaboration with additional continuo instruments.\n\nOn Ensemble Mirable's latest work, Conversations Galantes, the core ensemble of JungHae Kim on harpsichord and Joanna Blendulf on viola de gamba was joined by several performers of note including Elizabeth Blumenstock on baroque violin; Greer Ellison on baroque flute, and William Skeen on baroque cello." .

Soon after, in 2000, they brought in an old friend by the name of Rocky to lay down the drums.

Bay Area's heaviest new hard rock bands with their self-titled full-length release and live performances all over the Bay Area in 2004. Songs like Pull and Lunatic Lover deliver a sexy feel from the vocals with heavy sounds from Black Sabbath to White Zombie with a little bit of Nine Inch Nails influence. On the other hand, 8 Seconds, Hands of God and Devil's Blood are dark and heavy with a very serious and deliberate lyrical content that gives listeners a glimpse into some of Pain Factor's own personal experiences and demons. With heavy driven guitars, melodic yet aggressive vocals that are full of constant energy, and an extremely solid groove set forth by the bass and drums. Pain Factor is a S.F.

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/dac_crowell> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "I have always had trouble describing my work.\n\nThe problem is partly due to the fact that no easy 'pigeonhole' seems to exist for the music that I create. Some have tried to call it 'New Age'...but often it has too many abrasive elements, dark tones, and sometimes actual noise to fit that. Others have considered it 'Space Music'...which is a bit closer, although I'm not exactly sure what space my work would be describing. 'Ambient' therefore seems to fit best, as it does tend to be music that's suitable for a 'backdrop'...but at the same time, music that also describes a certain 'ambiance'. Music that's a snapshot of sorts of places, feelings, sensations, states of mind, and the like.\n\nYears and years ago, around the same time I was first learning piano as a small child, I also encountered the shortwave radio. It fascinated me...this box of strange sounds, pulsations, voices from other places phasing in and out. And then later in the 1960s, I heard the first stirrings of the Moog synthesizer...and others as well, as I attended a concert given by David Rosenboom while still in the second grade, with him performing his meditative style of electronics on a massive ARP 2500 rig. I suppose it was that formative experience that cemented what I was to try and do in my life.\n\nAs the 1970s progressed, I encountered a number of important musical 'signposts'...the work of Eno, Stockhausen, Cage, the music of the 'Krautrock' and punk scenes, and so on. All of these were, I think, important musical influences because they were not so much music that I only listened to, but music that made me want to try and do what I was hearing in it. I banged around some with some industrial/noise ideas, worked some in the early phases of the punk scene in Nashville (and yes, we did have one there), but it was also during this same period, around 1979-1980, that I started tinkering with tapes, delays, simple synths and sometimes just raw electronics. Everything that goes up to now seems to stem from there.\n\nI studied composition at Middle Tennessee State, under Dr. Thom Hutcheson, to whom I'm forever indebted because he allowed me a massive amount of rein to experiment in the electronic music studios there...as well as the commercial studios which were very much on par with typical industry-standard facilities of the day. These were critical times, with Hutch allowing me to try as much as I could, making important mistakes alongside successes. Later on, I studied under John Anthony Lennon at Tennessee, then with Salvatore Martirano at Illinois...both while I was in attendance there, and then off and on privately after a little 'falling-out' I had over some aesthetic differences with the rest of the composition faculty there. Sal taught me one thing that's been important...trust instinct and a belief in yourself and in your music. And from the early 1990s on, I have. Very much so.\n\nI went on from there, gradually building up a studio from a room-corner pile of gear into what I have now, which is requiring the complete remodeling of the walk-up attic of our rural home. In a decade's time, it grew like topsy. As did my music, as I explored deeper and deeper introspections in my 'ambient' work, and I explored the ranges of rhythmic expression in early IDM-style techno. But throughout both, there was and still is a strain of sound that owes its origins to the avant-garde. I have never really gotten away from it, and I don't think it would be in my best interests to try. It's the little bit of cayenne pepper that adds a 'zing' to what would otherwise be a typical dish. And given that I like spicy things, well...\n\nIn the past few years, I also was privileged to study with Karlheinz Stockhausen, at his Courses for New Music in Germany. It was not so much an experience of learning basics, but an affirmation that I was pursuing the right directions. Everything that he said or discussed, I already believed or had arrived at a similar conclusion myself. It was very liberating, I said at the time, and from those days on, I've felt a freedom to take what I feel, hear, envision, and set this down as best I can, following instinct, capturing the immediate 'now' of a work.\n\nAnd it's that 'now'...that is the key here. Framing the 'now', following a sense of the true nature of things, relying on instinct and a fluid mind...all of these things are my guideposts, along with so many things I've heard and experienced. Works that capture a certain 'now', such as \"Mendota\" and its impression of sunset colors sliding across a vast frozen lake and snowscape...or \"SPCTR\", which attempts to magnify the 'world inside a single tone'...these and so many other 'nows' are the ones I try to paint as best as I can in the sounds that I use. And perhaps the results evoke other things, as everyone's experience of something as fundamentally communicating as music is colored by their own experiences in so many ways.\n\nIn Zen disciplines, one hears of the concept of 'samu'...work as meditation or practice. And I view what I do, when I'm creating or performing, or even tweaking the settings on an existing work...as a manner of that same practice. But it's a practice with an open mind, receptive, waiting for something to sound from beyond the fundamental self and not merely 'just doing something, no matter what'. Creativity within a mindful state, and continuously trying to seize the 'now' in a work...it's not the easiest way I can think of to work, nor the easiest way that I have worked over the years. But it is the right way for me, as trying to be a 'New Music star' only ever led to a lot of ego-driven angst and annoyance. That's not who I am, not my nature, not my music.\n\nWhere from here, then? Who can say? Not me. None of those 'nows' have happened yet, so I suppose I'll simply have to wait for them so that I can encounter each one. I encourage you to wait and see what happens, as well." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/electric_frankenstei> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Electric Frankenstein - 13 years, over 100 record releases, and more! EF has almost single-handedly returned rock to its most basic and savage roots, the way it was meant to be. They have been receiving international acclaim for their exciting brand of Punk Rock and Roll, done with the great intensity of such bands as the Stooges, MC5, Dead Boys, NY Dolls, Damned, Black Flag, Misfits, AC/DC, Kiss, Cheap Trick, Aerosmith, etc. In addition to playing the most dynamic, ravenous, and menacing rock you've ever heard, EF recognizes the importance of integrity. From giving proper nods to the architects of street-level rock (Iggy and the Stooges, Dead Boys, AC/DC), to fiercely supporting DIY labels to their constant efforts to put fans first ahead of profit, EF is championing the cause to bring Rock back to the people and out of the hands of corporations. EF aren't young or pretty, and in case you haven't noticed neither is Real Rock & Roll. EF aren't here to be your girlfriend, they're here to ROCK! While stupid critics might say 'but, it's only rock n roll, its nothing new', EF fans are saying \"Damn, right!\" as they embrace the best of what's loud, fast, and rules from the last 30 years distilled down to one single organism. EF are one a mission to revitalize Rock & Roll and save people from the boredom of \"alternative music\". EF shows are intense, exciting, and inspiring.\n\nEF have been well reviewed in such magazines as Kerrang, Metal Hammer, Rock Sound, Alternative Press, Hit Parader, Seconds, Thrasher, Lollipop, Tail Spins, Rue Morgue, Maximum Rock N Roll, Flipside, Big Takeover, Paper, Aquarian Weekly, and countless European & Japanese magazines as well. NY Press picked EF as the \"Best Punk Band in NYC\". EF have received top 40 commercial radio airplay in the USA, Top 5-10 on many American college radio stations, and were Number One on Belgian, Finnish, and Swedish, etc., national radio. EF has even been picked by the Frankenstein Society as the bands representing the release of the Frankenstein commemorative stamp for the US Post Office. Not only are they one of the top most featured bands in the music press (currently #2 out of the Top 500!), but they have a loyal fan following in over 10 countries, with many bands citing EF as an influence and covering EF songs, and drawing thousands at music festivals internationally. EF's raw, powerful, and melodic Dead Boys meets AC/DC sound that has made them the Kings of High Energy Punk Rock N Roll!\n\nEF has been on over 40 of the world's best indie record labels (Sub Pop, Man's Ruin, Estrus, Get Hip, Victory, Au-go-go, TKO, Junk, etc.), selling hundreds of thousands of records. They have appeared on many European music televison shows and have had their songs or artwork featured in many videogames, movies and tv shows, including X-Files, Dawson's Creek, Signs, American Psycho 2, Flophouse, Tony Hawks Proskater, and the occasional porno flick as well. EF have since their inception been touring the US, UK, and Europe; often as headliner, even doing a sold out show at the Fillmore in SF and played to thousands at European festivals. EF played the 1997 Warp tour. They plan to tour Japan and Australia soon. EF have played with Danzig, Monster Magnet, Marilyn Manson, Hole, Social Distortion, The Misfits, Dead Kennedys, Dictators, Poison Idea, SOD, Joe Strummer, The Dwarves, Nebula, Orange Goblin, Electric Wizard, Turbonegro, Hellacopters, and many more. One of Joey Ramone's favorites, EF can count many other bands as fans of their music as well (Jon Spencer, Metallica, Monster Magnet, etc.), and they have returned the favor via the popular \"A Fistful of Rock & Roll\" compilation series, produced by EF guitarist, Sal Canzonieri.\n\nThe EF invasion has begun with Dark Horse publishing a 160 page book on EF. In 2004, EF will have a world wide art gallery and book signing tour for the upcoming book, \"Electric Frankenstein!\", as well as two fantastic EF clothing lines being done by Sourpuss Clothing and Lucky 13 clothing, and EF skateboards, toys, and videogames in the works too!\n\nEF play vintage equipment exclusively by Gibson, Ibanez, Fender, Ludwig, Ampeg, and Marshall and are sponsored by D'Addario guitar strings and GHS bass strings." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/drevo> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "One thousand years ago with the ward of Christianity to Ukraine the culture on these grounds did not begin anew, but its new page was opened. Alongside with the partially kept prior archaic layers and on their basis, Christianity has formed other original forms of culture, genres and styles.The influence of these processes on national music was especially expressive.\n\nIn pagan times the Kolyadkas (1,4,5,7-11,14,16,18,20,21) and Shchedrivkas (2,15,17,19) were a component of sacramentals related with New Year Day and vernal equinox. In later time Kolyadkas and Shchedrivkas (Christmas carols) became a symbol of Christmastime and other biblical dates and events. Obviously, such reassess of function has served as the reason of a semantic and stylistic variety of Kolyadkas and Shchedrivkas, represented on the disk.\n\nThe content of spiritual verses is always Christian. Their musical stylistics can inherit ancient epic singing-narrative tradition of east Slavs (6). The closest relation with Orthodox Christian religious doctrine and ideology, and also with Church service music is observed in folk canticles (3,12,13) and polychronions (20,22).\n\nThe biblical characters (Jesus Christ, The Theotokos, apostles Peter and Paul, saint George and saint Basil, Herod the king and others), and also place of events in folklore musical compositions as though they are passed through a prism of representation of the Ukrainian peasant consequently get typical features of Ukrainian everyday life.\n\nThe musical stylistics of the folk compositions, represented on the disk, shows different stages of Ukrainian folk singing history. Besides it is caused by the certain regional tradition. The heterophone Kolyadkas and Shchedrivkas from Polissia (North Ukraine) are the most archaic. The manner of their performance is especially ceremonial, and reminds a wail (2,8,11). In other regions of Ukraine such manner of singing is of rare occurrence (15). The characteristics of the later stylistic features are: adding of an independent top voice to a song melody (9,14,17,18); expansion and enriching the canvas with additional voices (1,12). So it forms chord-harmonic canticle style of 17-18 centuries (3,4,5,7,10,13,16,20,22) and change vocal manner to church singing (5,16). Dniper Livoberezhzhia singing (3,7,13) is noticeable for its extended, polyphonically wide style. It is very close to local lyrical singing tradition. In Polissia the singing of winter ceremonial songs could be traditionally accompanied by a violin (8,21).\n\nThis disk represents only small part of a unique musical folklore heritage of Ukrainian people. Tunes were recorded on an audio tape in 1978-1999. All of them were performed by singers from villages of three regions of Ukraine - Pripyat' Polissia, Poltavshchina and Cherkashchina. Ensemble \"Drevo\" has kept features of local musical stylistics (canvas , characteristic sound, a melodic variation, ornamentation) and a language dialect.\n\nThe ensemble \"Drevo\" (founded in Kiev in 1979) has begun the movement for authentic reproduction of traditional peasant music in musical culture of Ukraine. The art director is an ethnomusicologist, the candidate of an art criticism, senior lecturer of National musical academy of Ukraine Eugeny Efremov. The ensemble consists of the young scientists, who collect and investigate traditional national music of different regions of Ukraine - mainly Polissia, Podillia and Livobverezhzhia - for many years. \"Drevo\" recovers the material gathered in ethnographic expeditions without additional art processing, keeping its natural, original form." .

Created by Slade Anderson, the heavyweight rhythms of Burning Babylon's sound are firmly anchored in the 1970's Jamaican roots tradition, but with an ear for the neo-dub stylings of the present day.\n\nSlade came to dub relatively late in his musical career. For fifteen years he played guitar in various punk/metal bands in the Boston area (The Freeze, Straw Dogs), and at the time, \"heavyweight\" meant snarling guitars and screaming stacks of Marshall amps.\n\nDuring the mid-90's Slade began to play bass seriously, a move that coincided with a decision to investigate reggae. He went in search of a sound more earthy than the mainstream reggae he'd heard, and discovered artists like Glen Brown and King Tubby.\n\n\"It was drums drenched in reverb, horns and guitars echoing into oblivion, and the most heavyweight bass I'd ever heard,\" says Slade.\n\nIt wasn't long before Slade become throughly preoccupied with dub and was deep into study of the rhythms and vibe. Some time later, Slade recorded his first dub track, and Burning Babylon was born.\n\n\"I have my own unique take on dub,\" says Slade, \"but I've certainly been influenced by those that have come before me.\"\n" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/opened_paradise> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Opened Paradise was formed in Athens, Greece in the summer of 2003 with a sound and vision dedicated to all that they had held within up until that point. Featuring the incredible,hollowed-out goth vocals of Perilkis, the music is a heady blend of both tempting and aggressive moods, influenced by Fields of Nephilim and Garden Of Delight.\n\nOpened Paradise has played the Gagarin Open Air Festival, Dead Souls Festival, The Beyond the Veil Festival, The Athens Festival, and the Undersworld Club. They've shared the stage with Garden of Delight, Past Perfect, Type O Negative, Rotting Christ, Psyche, Arcturus, Theatre Of Tragedy, and Clan of Xymox.\n\nAt the end of March 2006, and after of long period of waiting, Opened Paradise released Occult, the result of much hard work and a realization of the desire to fully represent the internal, emotional lives of the band memebers. The album is mixed by Sakis Tolis (Rotting Christ) and mastered by Artaud Seth (Garden Of Delight, Lutherion)." .

He began sometimes at the end of 90's when he experienced a first taste of early music production and DJ-ing mainly on simple hardware and PC. After moving to London a few years ago I met some very interesting people, who helped me to understood the natural beauty of composing on PC and new wide world of electronic music.\n\nIt started in the end of 1999 and early 2000 when I officially get my first PC sequencer (Fruity Loops) and started to produce my first sounds in Trance style under the DJ Markitos name. After a few years of experiencing and studying music software, sound engineering I decided to try different genre music than what I had been thus-far doing (which was mostly Trance and Techno). By experimenting in my home studio with my sample library I made my first new album under SOLAR CYCLE name, a style that I call a \"summer cocktail of Chill out House, Electronica and Ambient styles\"." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/phantasm> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Phantasm, an award-winning quartet of viols, was founded in 1994 by Laurence Dreyfus. Inspired by the great twentieth-century string quartets, Phantasm enjoys taking risks in its search for renditions that renew the expressive traditions of early music. The quartet's international membership (from Britain, Finland and the US) were all trained on modern instruments, but each was drawn to consort playing because of the poignant sound of the viols and the special intimacy this music cultivates. Based in London, Phantasm has toured extensively throughout Europe, North America, and East Asia. They have appeared in festivals in London, York, Berlin, Utrecht, Stavanger, as well as in Iceland, Estonia, Poland and Finland and on concert series in Tokyo, Seoul, New York and Washington.\n\nLaurence Dreyfus, treble viol and director, was born in Boston, Mass. After learning the cello with Leonard Rose at Juilliard, he studied the viol with Wieland Kuijken at the Royal Conservatoire at Brussels, which awarded him its Diplome superieur. As a bass viol player, he has recorded CDs of Bach's viola da gamba sonatas, Marais's Pieces de violes and Rameau's Pieces de clavecin en concert (all on Simax), and collaborated with Silvia McNair in a Grammy-winning album of Purcell songs (on Philips). As a musicologist, Laurence has published Bach's Continuo Group and Bach and the Patterns of Invention (Harvard, 1987 and 1996); the latter won the Kinkeldey Award from the American Musicological Society for the best book of the year. Dreyfus taught at Yale, the University of Chicago, Stanford, and the Royal Academy of Music before becoming Thurston Dart Professor in 1995 at King's College London, where he teaches music history and performance. In 2002 he took British citizenship and was elected a Fellow of the British Academy.\n\nWendy Gillespie, treble viol, was born in New York and, after attending Wellesley College and the Amsterdam Conservatoire, began her performing career with the New York Pro Musica Antiqua. Since then she has played all over the world with leading ensembles including Les Filles de Sainte-Colombe, Ensemble for Early Music, Ensemble Sequentia, the Waverly Consort and the English Concert. She has participated in over 60 recordings for Virgin Classics, Decca, Nonesuch, Harmonia Mundi, among others. Whilst her speciality lies in consort music, Wendy has participated in many performances of both medieval and contemporary music. Wendy is a founding member of the viol consort Fretwork, who appear worldwide and have won a Grand Prix du Disque. Wendy makes her home in Bloomington, where she is Associate Professor at Indiana University and Acting Director of the Early Music Institute.\n\nJonathan Manson, tenor viol, was born in Edinburgh and received his formative training at the International Cello Centre in Scotland under the direction of Jane Cowan, later going on to study with Steven Doane at the Eastman School of Music in New York. While in America, he became involved with the performance of early music, and from there went to The Hague to study viola da gamba with Wieland Kuijken. On both cello and viola da gamba, Jonathan plays and records regularly with many leading early music ensembles. Recent chamber music recordings include a disk of Rameau's Pieces de clavecin en concert with Rachel Podger and Trevor Pinnock. In 1999, he became principal cellist of the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra, which in addition to a busy touring schedule has just finished recording the complete cantatas of JS Bach. Jonathan makes his home outside of London, where he has been appointed a professor at the Royal Academy of Music in London.\n\nMarkku Luolajan-Mikkola, bass viol, studied cello with Arto Noras at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, which awarded him its diploma in 1983. An interest in baroque music led him to a summer course in Norway with Laurence Dreyfus and later to Holland where he studied with Wieland Kuijken at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague and received postgraduate diplomas in viola da gamba and baroque cello. Markku teaches at the Sibelius Academy. He is active as a chamber musician and has given many solo recitals throughout Scandinavia as well as in the Netherlands, Italy, Russia, Estonia, and Poland. His recording of Marais' Suite d'un gout Etranger on ALBA records won a national award for excellence in his native Finland, and other solo CDs have likewise garnered critical acclaim, including discs of virtuoso viol music by Forqueray, Marais, and JS Bach's gamba sonatas, the latter two issued by BIS. A special interest of Luolajan-Mikkola's is contemporary music commissioned for the bass viol.\n\nGuests of Phantasm\n\nSusanna Pell, tenor viol, was born in Leicester and is a member of the viol consort Fretwork and medieval ensemble, The Dufay Collective. With both groups she has toured throughout the world and made many recordings for TV, radio, disc and film. She is also a member of Virelai, an ensemble specialising in music of the late medieval and early renaissance period. Susanna teaches consort playing at King's College London and is currently training to be a teacher of the Alexander Technique.\n\nAsako Morikawa, born in Takamatsu, Japan, started playing viola da gamba when she was 13 years old, but initially studied violin in the Toho Gakuen Music High School in Tokyo, before continuing her studies in viola da gamba at the Conservatorium with Tetsuya Nakano. In 1988 she moved to Holland to further her studies with Wieland Kuijken at the Royal Conservatorium in The Hague, where she received her Soloist's Diploma in 1993. Since 1997 she has made her home in London and has appeared internationally with groups such as Charivari Agreable, The English Concert, The King's Consort, and Fretwork." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/headroom_project> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "The Headroom Project aka Andreas Ecker fuses traditional world music with modern rhythms and audio design, resulting in driving beats full of natural power, color, and heat. Using the vastly improved studio technology of recent years, Ecker creates an incredibly distinctive and updated international sound, combining influences from Africa, the Middle East and Asia in a modern electronic milieu.\n\nAs a multi-instrumentalist with an abiding appreciation for a huge range of traditional vocals and rhythms in particular, Ecker has been creating experimental music for over 20 years. His tracks feature Asian and Middle Eastern beats whirling around Ecker's highly crafted vocal amalgamations in a heavily spiced mix of jazz, funk, and traditional beats. Others feature electronic rhythms and light atmospheric sounds: everything from the roaring sea to classical voices. If there's any one defining feature of Ecker's music it's fluidity, in fact, and his ability to blend cultures and continents so seamlessly is relevant in an ever more mobile and rapidly evolving society.\n\nEcker has been influenced by such artists as Peter Gabriel, King Crimson, Frank Zappa, Fred Frith, Aqsak Maboul, COS/Daniel Schell or Dead Can Dance. He lives in near Bonn/Germany and plays drums, bass, guitar, piano and various electronic devices. He gained musical knowledge and experiences as a member of several bands until he started his solo career in the late 1980's. In 1986 he reached his first international success with Perfume of Love as a member of the dance group Skala. During the 90's, he worked alone and developed his unique electronic world music style.\n" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/bledsoe> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "I was born to loving but rather unmusical parents. My father's singing repertoire was limited to \"The Old Gray Mare\" performed with a toneless and impish gusto which I only heard two or three times that I can recall. My mother tells me she used to be able to pick out tunes on the piano one-handed. As a high school senior I bought my first album: \"Al Hirt Plays the Theme from The Green Hornet.\" I plead humble beginnings.\n\nMy freshman year at college I received an all-important Christmas gift: a $13.95 guitar from JC Penneys. This may sound like the apocrypha of a slightly disoriented blues musician, but I have friends who will swear to the truth of it. And like all new and dedicated players, I played it until my fingers were ragged and sore if not actually bleeding.\n\nUnder the influence of the devil instrument my musical tastes expanded beyond the themes of television shows. At first, I learned to play the music of Mississippi John Hurt, John Fahey, and then as my skill increased, Leo Kottke and Ton Van Bergeyk. Even from the beginning though I wrote my own tunes-albeit in the styles of others. Over several decades I listened to classical, jazz-fusion, pop-rock, and many other kinds of music which had nothing to do with guitars.\n\nAfter trying my hand at many different careers including store clerk, chemical technician at a steel mill, raw materials sampler, custodian, musical instruments sales- and repair-person, house husband, art gallery director, artist-in-residence, semi-pro musician and T'ai Chi instructor, I settled on elementary school teacher. Part of my training as a teacher included a class on educational technology. Technology and learning quickly became my area of expertise, and today I am Educational Technologist (a noble-sounding title for a catch-all plate of responsibilities) in the Molalla River School District in Oregon. I also write monthly technology and education columns for several different teacher publications. In the mid-90's, I discovered digital sound design. My music world went sploosh. And maybe squish, too. Brace yourself, brothers and sisters. I gave up fingerpicking." .

Delivering hip-hop in its most pure and creative state, this classic recipe of one DJ (Denizen) and two Emcees (Celsius 7 and Spidey) provide consistent heat that has been attracting not only a larger fan base of late, but also an impressive string of musical cameos and collaborators such as Omega of Blackalicious and Raashan Ahmad of Crown City Rockers.\n\nDrawing on a wide range of production talent (DJ Denizen, DJ Ill Media, Dirt Nasty, and Slurface Tone), Psychokinetics are known for delivering a catchy underground sound that appeals to fans of Gorillaz, Ghostface Killah, and De La Soul. With styles ranging from bass heavy party anthems and rhymes flipped over jungle beats to downtempo reflective tracks and scratch laden instrumentals, Psychokinetics constantly demonstrate all the many the benefits of their long histories as musicians together; Celcius 7 and Spidey have amazing back-and-forth flow as Emcees and the group delivers a tight, polished sound that gets heads nodding and butts shaking.\n\nOn their latest album, Seven League Boots the four man crew eases off of the experimentation from their debut and focuses more on hip-hop that walks the fine line between underground and accessible. By blending the introspective and lyrical tracks like \"Badlands\" with bouncy dance tunes like \"Feeldismusick\" and \"Bigtime\" (Featuring Zion I), Psychokinetics are poised to garner a larger following throughout the hip hop community and beyond.\n\nNot only do Psychokinetics deliver in the studio, but the band is known for an energetic, engaging, and infectious live show as well. They've built a strong fan base from Japan to Denver to Hawaii, and of course the Bay Area, where they've shared the stage with such hip-hop luminaries including KRS-One, Biz Markee, DJ Premier, Black Sheep, Digital Underground, Kool Keith, and more. In addition to winning a John Lennon Songwriting Award, the Psychokinetics placed as finalists in the Musicians Atlas Independent Music Awards for best hip hop artist.\n\nIn the words of Celcius 7, \"This is music for the people, the artists, the dancers, the emcees, the DJs, those who love soulful music, and those who embrace the trials and celebrations of being alive.\" Watch out for these breakthrough artists as they extensively tour in support of Seven League Boots, and keep an eye out for their narrative lounge album due out in 2006." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/asteria> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "In October 2004, Asteria burst onto the national early music scene, winning Early Music America's first Unicorn Prize for Medieval and Renaissance Music with a performance heralded by the New York Times as \"intimate and deeply communicative...meltingly beautiful.\" This engaging duo brings out the passion and emotional impact of late medieval vocal and instrumental music with timeless love songs of wide appeal, transporting their listeners back to the age of chivalry.\n\nEric Redlinger's sweet tenor and skill on the lute are complemented by his expertise in early music, earned through study at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis and extensive archival research into original sources. Following graduation from Middlebury College, Eric spent several years immersing himself in the European musical archives of the Hague, Basel and Marburg. During this time he also did post-graduate studies in composition and musicology at the Frankfurt Conservatory of Music and studied medieval lute with Crawford Young and voice with Richard Levitt at the Schola. He now makes his home in New York, where he has studied with Drew Minter and Gary Ramsey.\n\nSylvia Rhyne brings to the partnership not only her quicksilver soprano but also a strong dramatic connection with the audience, gained from a professional career in musical theater. She has starred internationally as Christine in The Phantom of the Opera and on Broadway as Joanna in Sweeny Todd under the direction of Stephen Sondheim, Harold Prince, and Susan Schulman.\n\nRaised in London and the Pacific Northwest, Sylvia grew up surrounded by classical music, opera and dance. She pursued a passion for early music at Carleton College, guided by Stephen Kelly, taking leading roles in early operas and operettas on her way to a degree in music. She studied also with Wesley Balk at St. Olaf College and recorded with Dennis Russell Davies and the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra. Arriving in New York, Sylvia was invited to sing with the New York City Opera and began ongoing coaching with Marcy Lindheimer.\n\nEric and Sylvia first connected through singing with John Hetland's Renaissance Street Singers, a group that brings a cappella 15th and 16th century music to New York City sidewalks and parks. The pair immediately discovered their mutual interest in earlier repertoire and began meeting regularly to work on late medieval pieces, gradually developing their passionate approach to the music. Asteriaâs performances convey the anguish and ecstasy of the poetry and the rapturous beauty of the interweaving vocal and instrumental lines.\n\nThe result of Asteria's exploration can be heard on their first recording of 15th century chansons, Le Souvenir de Vous me Tue." .

The origin of this singing is from the 11th century (1091), in a monastery founded by inok Antony who arrived from Aphona.\n\nLavra's hymns organically synthesize Byzantine tradition and folk-singing culture. Under the influence of south-Slavic songs, Lavras way of singing gained a power and became one of brightest characteristics of the Orthodox world. During solemn festive services, in a state of prayer inspiration, singers unintentionally supplemented and developed this music. That is how the characteristic features of Lavra's singing appeared: the saturation with repeated single words, strongly marked melodism, and mobility of a music substance.\n\nLavra's singing is fixed by sound intonation contour of prayer. It is an exclamation of the heart rushed to God. This is the way used by a heroic monk to come up to God. This is living witness of the century-old tradition.\n\nLavra's hymns are notable for solemn harmony, spiritual touching, prayer inspiration and peculiarity. True beauty, inner might, greatness, power - these were the impressions for all orthodox Christians as well as foreigners. The success can be explained by the understanding of worship singing as spiritual. It is living witness of the orthodox tradition. It is an indicator of the might and greatness of the human spirit. It is distinctive musical chronicle of monastic life, the fire in their hearts, their spiritual depth and wealth." .

Their solid musicianship and incredible energy on stage have been drawing kudos across Houston and beyond. In the words of the Houston Press:\n\n\"Houston isn't the greatest city in the world for live jazz, but folks like Drop Trio are out to change that. They don't really fit in with the avant-garde, the martini sippers or the purists; they're more for the young cats who like their jazz a bit funked up with lots of energy. Drop Trio is anchored by a rhythm section tighter than the Texas education budget and a Rhodes keyboard that gets pushed to its limits on every cut.\"\n\nSince their debut in fall 2002, Drop Trio has quickly gathered a loyal Houston following. The trio tours regionally, playing packed rock and jazz clubs, coffee shops and festivals. Feature articles in the Houston Chronicle and nominations in the Houston Press Music Awards, only months after the band's inception, have given the band broad exposure and an exponentially growing fan base.\n\nDrop Trio's music careens between styles, with feet squarely in the New Orleans funk and Acid jazz camps, and nods to such diverse influences as progressive rock, classical composition and electronica. Their sound simultaneously appeals to the jazz sophisticate and the jam band devotee, while their virtuosity earns them fans in unlikely camps. In a recent appearance on Reprogram Radio, a hip hop and DJ showcase on KPFT 90.1, they earned the respect and appreciation of the local DJ scene as one DJ, put it, their music is \"top-notch stuff.\"" .

After spending time abroad, he experienced totally non-commercial style of music, which led to his buying an early sequencer and making his own electronic music.\n\nDJ Markitos's music is normally played around 140-160 BPM and usually has a four-to-the-floor beat. There is a great deal of repetition, provided by arpeggiators and bass lines. Listen for synth effects and layered sounds. The music often builds to a crescendo several times throughout a song. Many tracks devolve into a spacey ambiance or floating piano-type lines at the end.\n\nThe \"Slower Emotions (138 BPM Remixes)\" album is a collection of remixes of songs from DJ Markitos' earlier albums, changed to be at a constant temp of 138 beats per minute. Originally, these songs were remixed for a company releasing the music as exercise-music, sold for Dance, Aerobics and other places where a constant tempo would be helpful. The music worked differently slowed down (most of the songs were originally faster) and it was thought that a release of the remixes might be interesting." .

When DeVito teamed up with keyboardist Meengs (formerly with the Florida band Sonic Erotica), the project took a new turn and became its very own piece. DeVito's contributions on guitar to LVX Nova hearken back to Edgar Froese's work with Tangerine Dream, and his solo style is reminiscent of early David Gilmour.\n\nIn the summer of 1996, the due pressed 1,500 CDs and began to promote their new record. DeVito, a former BMG employee, used the Internet to promote the release and built an incredible number of underground contacts along the way. When Miramar signed the band in March of 1997 there was already quite an impressive archive of underground press they had garnered on their own.\n\nSince then, the band has done remixes for a number of projects out of Europe and is currently working on a live performance to support the new release.\n\nBand Members:\n  * Bobby DeVito -- guitars, noises, and engineering/production\n  * Mike \"Sonic\" Meengs -- all synths, samples, engineering, production, weird noises, random samples, lush washes, nearly everything but bobby d's parts\n  * Brian Stevenson -- spoken word lyrics and vocals\n  * Curtis H Hayes -- Producer and knob twirler for all guitar production and mixing, and a few odd noises\n  * George Harris -- Panda Productions -- mastering and editing and guitar advice\n  * Mark Prator -- Morrisound Studios -- final mastering and sweetening for the Miramar release\n  * Tom Mehren -- A? from Miramar, and his eyeball is on our album art\n  * Michael Boydstun -- Video Director of the LVX NOVA video" .

Bach Sonatas. Zucker is featured in Inspirational Stories from the World's Best Flute Players alongside Sir James Galway, Julius Baker, Herbie Mann, and Ian Andersen. Fanfare Magazine refers to Zucker \"as a forceful advocate for 20th century music\" and when she was awarded the Aaron Copland Fund for Music from the American Music Center to record the flute compositions of Alec Wilder, Fanfare Magazine stated 'this disc fills an important niche in American Music as well as flute literature.\"\n\nSara Andon:Acclaimed for her rich ravishing sound and deeply engaging musical interpretations, Sara Andon is a versatile performer in many genres including solo, chamber, symphonic, operatic, ballet, and Broadway. She has performed with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Los Angeles Mozart Orchestra, Glendale Symphony, New Haven Symphony, Orchestra New England, San Francisco Western Opera Theater, and many others. Her Broadway performances include engagements with Peter Pan, Les Miserables, and Beauty and the Beast.\n\nGerald Ranck:A \"superartist\" in the opinion of William F. Buckley, Jr., Gerald Ranck gave the first New York performance of the Bach Art of Fugue in 1967. In 1980-81 he performed Bach's complete solo harpsichord music, a feat he repeated in 1985-86 at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. In 1992-95 he played all 555 sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti, revealing the great variety of these short works in performances that were \"precise, energetic, and inventive\" according to the New York Times.\n\nRichard Locker: A consummate stylist and instrumentalist, cellist Richard Locker is one of New York's top musicians and enjoys an exceptionally varied musical life as soloist, chamber musician, teacher, orchestral principal cellist and recording artist. Since winning awards from the American Bach Foundation and the National Arts Club, Licker has toured the world as soloist and chamber musician, served as principal cellist with Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival and New York City Ballet Orchestras, and with the American Symphony Orchestra, Orchestra of St. Luke's, Brooklyn Philharmonic, et. al., and taught cello at Princeton University. He has performed in over 4000 recording sessions with diverse artists ranging from Leonard Bernstein,Pinchas Zuckerman, James Galway, Wynton Marsalis, McCoy Tyner, Elvis Costello, and hundreds of others, and in more 150 film scores." .

Solid, sensual, organic, electronic music, timeless and multi-layered, seamlessly interwoven with live instrumentation, and rooted in diverse and complimentary musical genres. Respectfully grounded in tradition, but pursuing the freedom necessary to break new ground, hands upon black earth is another step in the evolution of electronic-based music.\n\nIn hands upon black earth, composer and performer bobby cochran has created a collection of songs as diverse as they are connected, eluding simple categorization. Tying the project together is an occult pattern of will, desire and worship, driven by a sincere passion, fueled by a persistent discontent with his own limitations.\n\nSensual and pensive. Meditative and exultant. Flowing, languorous beats with a hard and unrestrained backbone. Inspired words. Pain and passion. Desire and expectation. A union of love and will. These are some of the elements that unite to create hands upon black earth.\n\nContaining layered symbols and hidden devotions, hands upon black earth is a representation of a process of personal exploration and expansion, pushing against convention and expectation. A widely varied yet continuous, lush, 63-minute electronic and acoustic tapestry of auditory experience, this album is a doorway to the seen and unseen." .

He later combined his double bass and gamba studies with a masters and Ph.D. in physics.\n\nMeulenbroeks played double bass in the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam and gave many recitals and solo concerts in the Netherlands and abroad, including numerous radio and television performances. He also still managed to find time to play in rock, jazz, and pop bands.\n\nFrom 1995 onwards, Ralph Meulenbroeks has specialised in performing early music, studying viola da gamba with Jaap ter Linden. He is now an esteemed soloist in works such as the passions, sonatas, and cantatas of J.S. Bach, and has released several CDs. His previous CD, Voix Humaines with music for viola da gamba solo was proclaimed \"a true monument for the art of gamba playing\" in the Dutch press.\n\nRalph Meulenbroeks played in the Fringe of the Early Music Festival in Utrecht (from 2000 to 2002), in the Early Music Network (2003 and 2004), and his solo recitals have taken him throughout Europe, United States, and China.\n\nOn Moved by Marais, Meulenbroeks plays a six string viola da gamba by Georg Aman (Augsburg), early 18th century on the G minor and G major suites, and a seven string viola da gamba after Michel Colichon (1693) by Reinhard Ossenbrunner (2003) on all other tracks.

Both are educated sound engineers living in the cities of Norrkoping and Orebro, Sweden. Bjorn is the main sound and sample producer. He provides Processor's music with the edgy fx and industrial soul.\n\nBjorn likes to experiment with synthesizers and effect routings. Bjorn often has sessions in the night doing mixes as long as five hours or until his computer crashes. Then he sends material over the internet to Johan.\n\nBjorn has his musical roots in the 80s industrial and electronic music, listening to bands such as Skinny Puppy, Ministry and Frontline Assembly. The interest for electronic music made Bjorn want to compose his own music. Bjorn is making trance-remixes for other projects alongside with the project Processor and he is also studying music production at the University.\n\nJohan experiments, mixes and arrange the samples from Bjorn. Johan prefers a straight beat but he is also a fan off breaks and drum and bass. Johan often samples voices from the Television but he also samples recorded voices.\n\nThe voice is not the most important ingredients in a song. Johan and Bjorn use the voice more like an instrument. The voice can be mixed lower and it's not the headline of the music. But they also do remix vocal artists. Before Processor, Johan was very much into ambient music, trance and jungle.\n\nThis particular album contents industrial techno with an edge off breaks. The beats are very heavy and the sounds are heavy processed!\n\nWe do not intend to take over the world, just the dance floors!\n\nJohan Isaksson also releases his own music under the name of Magnatune artist \"Wicked boy\"." .

Todd Levy perfectly brings out the mellow woodiness of the clarinet, while Elina Abend offers the perfect counterpoint in the form of gloriously silky piano playing.\n\nTodd Levy made his debut at the age of seventeen performing the Hindemith Clarinet Concerto at Lincoln Center, and is now Principal Clarinet of the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra as well as the Santa Fe Opera. Levy is a member of the clarinet faculty at the University of Wisconsin/Milwaukee and his solo career highlights include appearances at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival, and with the Israel Philharmonic in Tel-Aviv. Other highlights include performances of the Brahms F minor Sonata arranged for clarinet and orchestra by Luciano Berio, the world premiere of Peter Schickele's Concerto for Clarinet and Flute, and the European premiere of John Harbison's Concerto for Clarinet and Oboe.\n\nAn active chamber musician, Mr. Levy has collaborated with members of the Guarneri, Julliard, Cleveland, Orion, and Ying quartets, as well as the Beaux Arts Trio, Midori, Christop Eschenbach, Richard Goode, Mitsuko Uchinda, Marc Niekrug, Carol Wincenc, and Paula Robison. He has recorded for Deutsche Grammophon, Decca, BMG, and Telarc. He is a graduate of the Julliard School where he studied with David Weber.\n\nBorn in Caracas, Venezuela, pianist Elena Abend is well known as a soloist and chamber musician. She has performed with all the major orchestras of her country and has recorded with the Filarmonica Nacional. As the recipient of a scholarship from the Venezuelan Council for the Artst, Ms. Abend studied at the Jilliard Schoool, where she received her Bachelor and Master degrees. She has performed at the Purcell Room on London's South Bank, Avery Fisher Hall in New York's Lincoln Center, Weill Recital hall at Carnegie Hall, and the Academy of Music with the Philadelphia Orchestra.

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/amoeba> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Amoeba is the result of a multi-decade collaboration between ambient composer Robert Rich and multi-instrumentalist Rick Davies. The two first met in 1979 after Davies returned from a stretch in England and Spain, and throughout the '80s the two would collaborate on several bands, including Quote Unquote and Urdu. To the union Davies brought a wealth of musical experience, and the ability to play winds, guitars, synth and percussion. He also brought an understanding of electronic music which had been deepened during his time editing magazines Music Technology and Home & Studio Recording.\n\nExperimental musician Robert Rich was one of the first people to work with micro-toned synthesizers, and had performed legendary \"sleep concerts\"?eight hour long concerts of ambient music designed to be listened to by a sleeping audience. He also released several solo albums like Trances/Drones which came out in 1983 and Rainforest, which was issued in 1989. He has worked with Steve Roach, David Tom, Lustmord, Lisa Moskow, Vidna Obmana and Forrest Fang. Indeed, his musical aspirations reached all of the way back into childhood, when he was fascinated by the rhythms and textures of sounds in the world around him (croaking frogs, ventilator shafts, etc.). He built his first synthesizer from a kit at the age of 13.\n\nThe second album produced by Amoeba, Watchful is a masterpiece of collective work by Davies and Rich. Featuring a combination of multi-layered ambient textures and pop instrumentation, the album resembles many works that also existed on the edge of pop, like those by Talk Talk and Dead Can Dance.

Upon meeting in a comic book shop, the two future rappers discovered that in addition to their mutual love of comic books, cartoons and animation, they shared a deep feeling for hip-hop. Both had previously been in bands?Keith in high-energy funk outfit Butt'er Crunch, and Jeff in New York hardcore punk group Stisism. Each longed to be on stage again, but it took a little persuading for Keith (a successful comic strip writer and artist) to add performing into his already busy cartooning schedule , yet eventually he gave in.\n\nAdopting the personas of K-Squared and The Noble Def G, Keith and Jeff began writing lyrics in earnest and were eventually joined by bass player Adam Lodge, drummer Adam Lipsky, and guitarist Jeff Ranney. Together, the band has taken its show up and down the West Coast and beyond, opening for Black Eyed Peas, Spearhead, Fishbone, G Love & Special Sauce, Insolence, and De La Soul, as well as headlining many shows of their won.\n\nThe eMPee's self-released debut CD, Twist the Nob sold 20,000 copies and was selected one of 1997's 10 best albums by the San Jose Metro, and one of the Top 100 Indie Releases of the year by PULSE! Magazine. Their second studio full-length, Bohemian Rap CDrecently won a 2004 California Music Award for Outstanding Rap Album." .

The group takes its name from 17th century composer Georg Philipp Telemann (believed to be the firstto write music specifically for violin, flute, and clavier), and its repertoire includes works by Handel, J.S. Bach, C.P.E. Bach, Couperin, Vivaldi, Bruch, Cui, Ibert, and Martinu. Telemann Trio Berlin has performed to international critical acclaim, with tours in Europe, America, Japan, and South East Asia. The trio features Lauretius Dinca on violin, Cornelia Gehlmann on flute, and Craig Hansen on piano, organ, and harpsichord.\n\nLauretius Dinca was born in Bukarest, studied at the conservatories in Bukarest and Lubeck, and has been a prize winner in numerous international competitions: Tibor Varga, Louis Spohr, and Canales. From 1980-1984 he was concertmaster of the Frankfurt Radio Orchestra and then performed as first violinist in the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. Dinca is winner of The Viottis Prize, and in 1992 received the Croce Dell'ordine al Merito Melitense. Since 1995, he's performed as first violinist in the Philharmonische Geigen Berlin and plays a violin made by Andreas Guarnerius.\n\nCornelia Gehlmann was born in Speyer/Rhein, studied at the Akadamie of music in Lubeck with Professor Gunther Pohl as well as in Frankfurt, where she received the academic title of Concert Soloist. She currently maintains a busy schedule of chamber music performances with the Telemann Trio Berlin as well as chamber music ensembles from the Berlin Philharmonic.\n\nCraig Hansen was born in Bloomington, Indiana and received his education at both San Diego State University and the Conservatory of Music in Basle, Switzerland. He studied piano with Arthur Lambert, harpsichord with Hans Goverts and organ with Daniel Burton and Rudolf Scheidegger. He has given solo recitals in the U.S., Japan, Canada, and throughout Europe, as well as extensive chamber music performances, including televisiona and radio appearances with the N.H.K.

After one of Rob's brothers introduced him to Winston's music, Rob realized that his musical future was going to take a different path than the one set by his teachers.\n\n\"It was so different than typical piano music,\" says Costlow. \"It's what drove me to create my own. I said to myself 'I can do this--this is a way that I could actually enjoy piano and benefit from all of these lessons and practicing.' It allowed me to express myself and also provide a great stress relief.\"\n\nWhile Rob has come a long way since those lessons and from his native Indianapolis, his love for creating original compositions is still at the heart of his contemporary solo piano music. His compositions are inspired by love of his family, including his wife Melissa. Travels throughout the United States, Italy, and the Caribbean also provide inspiration.\n\n\"Traveling shows me how much is out there and how there is so much diversity in the world,\" says Rob.\n\nGrowing up in a large family helped Rob become focused and tenacious. As the youngest of six boys, Rob had to get used to seizing every opportunity that came his way. While working on his Masters Degree, Rob unofficially started his own record label based on a fictitious business plan. In 1998, Rob released his first demo album. In 2002, Rob released his first professional solo project, Sophomore Jinx, containing all original music. His ultimate goal is to create music for television and film.\n\n\"Music is a release from the stresses of the world,\" says Costlow. \"I never force myself to write. I do it when it comes to me. I'm taking things a day at a time.\"" .

Their sound betrays them as big followers of the music of 80s; their members are indeed fans of very varied bands that go from Depeche Mode to The Smiths, from The Cure to Portishead, from Aviador Dro to Lamb or from Fangoria to Covenant.\n\nSelf-Delusion has been a supporting act for bands such as Wolfsheim and De/Vision, VNV Nation and Apoptygma Berzerk.\n\nWith \"Happiness hurts\", Self-Delusion makes a move to find a place in the electronic national scene as they have obtained it, occasionally, in the international one, where they have managed to edit and to receive prizes as the fourth position in the Clavia MP3 Competition (contest organized by the well known synths manufacturer Clavia -nordlead-) thanks their song \"Christine\", included in \"Happiness hurts me\"." .

Tom devotes an enormous amount of time and energy to transcribing his understanding of life to song.\n\n\"I write about the world as I encounter it,\" he says. \"I have a fairly positive outlook without being blinded by optimism.\"\n\nThrough the years Tom has learned to support his own music in many ways. He plays guitar and bass, sings and has become proficient in the art of recording, maintaining a high standard for the presentation of his material. To that end, Tom enlisted John Marsden of Little-Big Sound to mix his new album.\n\nTom Paul's original and accessible poetry, along with his keen sense of melodic- oriented songwriting, make his tunes attractive to other artists' interpretations and, through his own devise, stand strongly." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/evera> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Soprano Emily Van Evera is an uncommonly versatile singer. Her luminous voice blends sense with sensuousness, and can sound at once tender and thrillingly beautiful. Fittingly, Van Evera's inspiration for her first Avie recording is Lady Penelope Rich, a \"heart-stealing goddess\" who was sister to the Earl of Essex, muse to poets and musicians and the devoted mistress to Lord Mountjoy. She also inspired some of the finest music by composers of Elizabethan England.\n\nThe music on My Lady Rich ranges from the Shakespearean \"How should I your true love know\"?from Hamlet, a mad song of Ophelia's, the tragic character to whom Lady Rich's predicament has been likened?to the Spanish \"Vuestros ojos\" (Lady Rich was famously fluent in Spanish); from the spirited \"Hampton Court Masque\" in which Lady Rich took part in 1604 to the sorrowful \"And is it night,\" a nocturnal yearning for a lost lover.\n\nEmily Van Evera has won international acclaim for her numerous ground-breaking and award-winning recordings, particularly of earlier repertoire. Her chart-topping CD of the music of Hildegard von Bingen was singled out by The Gramophone for her characteristic expressivity: \"the sheer power of the words comes across nowhere else as strongly as in Van Evera's performance.\"" .

This instrument has a pentatonic tuning and has 5 holes like the shakuhachi, but has a much deeper and more mellow sound than the shakuhachi.\n\nIt used to be played more often in the old days of Japan, but was more and more replaced by the shakuhachi during the twentieth century.\n\nIn the same process it changed from an instrument of meditation that was mainly used by a certain buddhist sect of wandering monks (komuso), who played traditional religious pieces (honkyoku) only, to an instrument of more 'worldly' use played with other instruments and in different kinds of music.\n\nTilopa's master, Koku Nishimura, was one of the first to revive the old tradition of kyotaku.\n\nFor a few years now, Tilopa has been giving occasional concerts with Sangeet P. Sieben. Sieben is a gifted guitarist who started out with jazz and rock music years ago, picked up other instruments on his musical life journey and now feels very much at home with ethno-, world- and meditation-music. One of the results of this extraordinary meeting is the CD 'Pictures of Silence', which is a live recording of several improvisational sessions at an art exhibition in Cologne/Germany." .

Ambient Teknology fuses early synth from the 1970's and 80's with the dance driven drum and bass riffs of the late 90's, resulting in a driving, upbeat sound full of ecclectic beats and the deliciously dark undertones of early new wave.\n\nBorn in Cornwall, England in 1966, Mark P. lived and grew through the UK punk and electronic scene and developed a sense of the true depth of sound synthesisers were meant to bring to music. Much of Ambient Teknology's music, in fact, is based on ideas involving a departure from the old, and a dawn into the new, and Mark continually incorporates new ideas, techologies, and sounds into his music as electronica and techno continue to evolve.\n\nSelf proclaimed as the only electronic artist in Cornwall, Mark has created quite a following for himself there. The official Ambient Teknology website receives thousands of hits from all over the world, and locally Ambient Teknology sells more than 100 CDs a month. Dedicated to creating exceptional dance underground for the local scene and the world at large, Ambient Teknology is on a mission to make music that the old and young alike can touch, feel, breathe, and most importantly?enjoy." .

Our music combines the sacred texts and liturgies of many traditions to reveal the deep knowing of our hearts, that all life is one. We send these songs out as prayers on the breath of our hearts. May they help to bring healing and a sense of wonder at the ways we have named and connected to the Divine.\n\nYa Elah's Vocalists are: Marsha Attie, Cyrise Beatty, Stephanie Bernstein, Alisa Fineman, Nina Perlman, Melita Siberstein and artistic director Bon Singer.\n\nGari Hegedus ('ud, percussion)\n\nGari Hegedus is regarded as an exceptionally accomplished string player. His talent is expressed on the violin, viola, 'ud, sarod, saz, setar, tar, sarangi, and a range of other stringed instruments, including the bowed tambur and mandecello. Gary's musical endeavors began with the study of early European, Celtic, and Breton music. This was the start of a fruitful journey, which led him to intense study and performance of Turkish classical and Mevlevi ceremonial music. He is a core member of the acclaimed group Stellamara, contributing much to its rich and varied sounds.\n\nIn addition to his instrumental proficiency, he is perhaps most recognized for his remarkable compositional skills and his signature, deeply soulful style and beautifully rich improvisations.\n\nShira Kammen (vielle, harp, violin d'amore)\n\nShira Kammen received her degree in music from UC Berkeley and studied vielle with Margaret Tindemans. A member for many years of Ensemble Alcatraz, Project Ars Nova, and Medieval Strings, she has also worked with Sequentia, Hesperion XX, the Boston Camerata, and the King's Noyse. She is also the founder of ClassV Music, an ensemble dedicated to performance on river rafting trips. She has performed and taught in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Israel, Morocco, and Japan, and on the Colorado and Rogue rivers. She had been featured on numerous early music and folk music recordings.\n\nShira happily collaborated with vocalist John Fleagle for fifteen years, and now performs with several new groups: a medieval ensemble, Fortune's Wheel; a new music group, Ephemeros; an eclectic ethnic band, Panacea; and Trouz Bras, a band devoted to the dance music of Celtic Brittany.\n\nTim Rayborn (percussion, psaltery, sehtar, santur)\n\nThough raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, Tim Rayborn lived for nearly seven years in England, where he completed a Ph.D. on the early crusades at the University of Leeds, and worked in the field of early music. He founded and directed Ensemble Florata, whose recordings for London-based ASV/Gaudeamus received international critical acclaim. In addition, he worked with the noted British medieval ensemble Tintagel, and performed with them on BBC broadcasts, Belgian live radio, and in Majorca, as well as their tour of the Pacific Northwest in the U.S.\n\nTim has toured the UK and continental Europe extensively, and worked with traditional musicians in Marrakech and Istanbul, as well as being invited to collaborate with Persian classical musicians in Iran. He plays more than 30 musical instruments. He has recently completed two new solo CDs.\n\nDylan Eliyahu Sills ( flutes)\n\nEliyahu Sills studied jazz performance on the upright bass at the New School ofJazz in NYC in the early 1990's, performing as sideman as well as a band leader in renowned jazz clubs such as The Village Gate and Small's. After leaving New York he fell in love with the flute, and choose to teach himself to play the ancient instrument in order to apply his theories of music education on himself. Eliyahu soon fell under the spell of sufi music of Turkey and the reed flute of the middle east, the Nay, as well as the bamboo flute of India, the Bansuri. He began to studyÃ and perform on these instruments under the guidance of the masters Omar Faruk Tekbilek andÃ Steve Gorn, and is now a dedicated student of the world renowned master of Bansuri, G.S. Sachdev (www.bansuri.net/gssachdev). Eliyahu currently performs middle eastern music on the Nay with Za'atar (Zaatar.web.com), African folk music on the upright and electric bass withÃ thePalm Wine Boys (www.palmwineboys.com), Indian Ragas on the Bansuri in a duo with Jason Ranjit Parmar, with the woman's vocal group Ya Elah (www.YaElah.com) on upright bass, silver flute, nay, and bansuri. He also freelances as leader and sideman in various projects. He has recently recorded \"Breath\" a CD of meditative flute music." .

No catchy pop here, just the best soulful hard rock that will make you rethink your existence. The apocalypse is now. SoulPrint has been shattering eardrums along the central coast for nearly five years, and once LaBarre graduates @ Cal Poly, they plan to tour the United States.\n\nJason Estes: Jason shows his dedication by driving back and forth from his hometown of Santa Barbara to SLO at least three times a week, just for the band. His passions for singing and expressing himself distinguish him greatly from other vocalists. There's not much else to say about him... and he never really has much to say.\n\nRyan Estes: AKA Rage. If you know him, you know why this is such a fitting nickname. Attempts with every new song to play more chords, and faster. Has a thing for breaking strings and falling over on stage\n\nJohn Reisz: John started playing drums just so the band could form. Seven years later... he adds his own unique flow to the edginess of the thrashing guitars. That is, if he isn't pounding away at the double kick.\n\nRyan LaBarre: The newest member of the band and the only one not born and raised in SLO, Ryan hails from way in up Portland, Oregon. He started out playing guitar, but was drawn to the powerful sounds of the bass two years ago. Less than a week after meeting Rage and Flow at Cal Poly, he found himself playing a show with them at a party in Isla Vista. Luckily, the fans were as drunk as he was, so it didn't matter that he was totally winging it. Now, thank god, he actually knows what he's doing on stage." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/fulton> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Recognized worldwide as a leading pioneer in the field of historical harps, Cheryl Ann Fulton has had internationally successful performing, recording, teaching and scholarly research career since 1986. She is America's premier performer of historical harps, and one of the few harpists in the world to play triple harp, medieval harp and contemporary lever harps. Her solo performance for the 2002 World Harp Congress in Geneva affirmed her rank as one of the world's leading harpists. Known for her exceptional artistry, in the last decade she has become a renowned and highly sought after teacher of her masterful and expressive technique. Her solo recital performed at the John F. Kennedy Center featured five historical harps on one program of which the Washington Post said, \"Fulton drew from all of them a serene and delicate sound.... remarkable instruments which Fulton played with total skill and reverent affection.\"\n\nA versatile recording artist, she can be heard on over thirty albums and soundtracks broadly ranging from medieval, baroque, orchestral, and contemporary music to Celtic music and film scores, on major labels including PolyGram, Deutche Harmonia Mundi, Koch International Classics, Nonesuch, Erato, Dorian, Gourd Music, and others. Her first solo album, The Airs of Wales, brought her recognition and acclaim as a \"genuine virtuosa of her instrument.\" A composer as well as performer, her original compositions from her second solo album, The Once & Future Harp, have been featured on National Public Radio.\n\nA leading scholar in the field of historical harps, Dr. Fulton, a Fulbright scholar, is a contributing scholar for the new edition of the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians and has written a chapter for A Performers Guide to Medieval Music (IU Press, 2000). She was awarded the Burton E. Adams Prize for Academic Research for her doctoral thesis on the history of the triple harp.

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/satamian> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Of Armenian origin, composer, pianist and teacher, Gerard Satamian was born and raised in Beirut, Lebanon. Although his family could hardly support their basic needs, his mother, noticing his early musical inclinations, arranged for him to take private piano lessons.\n\nAt the age of 13 he entered the Beirut National Conservatory of music. At school in Lebanon, Satamian excelled in literature and languages, and for many years immersed himself in the French writers and poets. His early years were filled with the musical traditions of many cultures and styles: Armenian, Arabic, and Western, such as Romanticism and Impressionism.\n\nIn 1977, during the Civil War in Lebanon, Satamian moved to Armenian to continue his piano studies at the Gomitas Conservatory of Music in Yerevan. There he was exposed to the Armenian and Russian composers. He also pursued his love for singing through vocal coaching, finding voice and most natural and expressive instrument. He received his Masters degree in piano, in 1982, but vocal music had found a special place in his heart.\n\nIn 1983, Satamian left Lebanon with his family for Los Angeles. Deeply affected by the tragedies of the war in Lebanon he turned to the Scriptures for answers. For the next 10 years he taught piano while concentrating most of his energy on his spirituality.\n\nAlthough Satamian never studied composition formerly, he always knew he had a gift for writing melodies. Having moved to Vancouver, Canada in 1989 he further developed his composition skills. Chansons sans Paroles (1989) written originally for voice and piano and the Suite Lyrique (1994) are short stories inspired by images of the past and people he knew.\n\nFrancois Houle\n\nFrancois Houle's energetic performances are bridging the gap between the new music and improvisation. He went to McGill University in Montreal where he received his bachelor of music degree and graduated with a Masters degree from the Yale school of music. He also spent two years in residence at the Banff Centre for the arts. His great interest in contemporary music has led him to perform under the direction of Bruce Mather, Mauricio Kagel, Arthur Weisberg, Toru Takemitsa and Yannis Xenakis, among others.\n\nSince moving to Vancouver in 1990, Houle has established itself as a strong new voice on the Canadian creative music scene. Recent performances include all Western Canadian gas festivals, the Ottawa Jazz Festival, the Festival de Music Actuelle de Victoriaville, new music across America, time flies, and Seattle World Jazz Festival. He has also dedicated much of his time composing for his own critically acclaimed group Francois Houle Et Cetera." .

One of only a handful of players who specialize in the cittern, he is involved in recording projects and performances dedicated to 18th-century composers for plucked string instruments. During the 1980s Doc Rossi was resident at London's acclaimed Islington Folk Club and The Last Straw, a London club that featured less traditionally oriented acoustic music. He has appeared at the Hudson River Revival, the Philadelphia Folk Festival, and the National Folk Festival (UK). Also a scholar, Dr. Rossi has published a modern edition of Thomas Robinson's New Citharen Lessons (1609), plus articles dealing with guitar and cittern history, and with Shakespeare, Brecht, and the Beat Generation.\n\nAndrea Damiani studied the lute with Diana Poulton, Anthony Bailes and Hopkinson Smith. He has performed and recorded extensively across Europe and the USA, both as soloist and continuo player on archlute and theorbo. His passion for research on lute history and literature has led him to discover and record some previously unknown sources: J'ay pris amour, devoted to the heart-shaped manuscript preserved in Pesaro, Biblioteca Oliveriana, is the main early lute source before Ottaviano Petrucci's prints; and Folias, containing music from 17th-century central Italian sources for archlute, theorbo and guitar, among them a recently found manuscript containing unknown guitar pieces by Giovanni Paolo Foscrini. He has also recorded a CD dedicated to Il Fronimo of Vincenzo Galilei. Mr. Damiani has been invited to teach at several international early music courses, such as those held in Chiusi della Verna, Erice, Lanciano, and by the Cini Foundation of Venice. He regularly teaches at the International Summer Course held in Urbino. He is Lute Instructor at the Conservatorio S.

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/rebel_rebel> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Got glam? Hollywood shock rock kings Rebel Rebel have it to burn. Not only did the band recently inspire its very own brand of hair gel from P/Taylor USA, but when they found themselves banned from most live L.A. venues for their infamous stage antics, they did what any true glam rocker would do: they opened their own nightclub.\n\n\"When you come to one of our shows, you don't know if you're going to get drunk with us or burn the place down, and that's what kids love today,\" says guitarist Teddy Heavens. They want to be scared and have a good time. NO RULES. We offer something to look at and participate in. Slam dancing and moshing are so boring. If you like being entertained and partying, then you'll love us.\"\n\nR2 influences include Kiss, Plasmatics, and Alice Cooper, and the band has collaborated with producers Jon Mathias (Meatloaf, Kiss) and Brian Kehew (Air, Alice Cooper). Explode Into Space is Rebel Rebel's 2005 release of deliciously riff heavy rock, and the band also recently kicked in contributions to Lost Anarchy and Hollywood Rocks?compilations of legedary L.A. glam bands including Poison, WASP, Stryper, Great White, and Warrant.\n\nKnown for their insanely fun, high energy live act, Rebel Rebel tours widely and recently performed at La Scene Bastille in Paris with Undercover Slut, as well as The Cat Club in West Hollywood and The Aristocrat in Las Vegas. Their tour was recently documented by a Fox News team, which followed the band around for a week. Rebel Rebel was also recently featured in Critical Vision's hilarious anthology of worst-ever road experiences, Gigs From Hell." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/stargarden> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "It all started with a shoebox and rubber bands....\n\nBorn the son of an electronics industry father, Bobby DeVito was exposed to the wonders of computers and electronics at an early age. His parents noticed a certain musical bent when they discovered the young child placing rubber bands on a shoebox in tonal order. Soon the budding musician received a guitar for his birthday.\n\nDuring the early days of his youth, Bobby often accompanied his father to work, marveling at the rooms full of mainframe computers at Control Data. He and his father were electronics hobbyists as well, building a digitally controlled television with remote control in 1976. At this time, Bobby got his hands on his first synthesizer - an Arp Axxe. Running this basic monosynth through an MXR delay and flanger opened new worlds of sonic discovery. Nevertheless, the guitar proved the be his main instrument for many years, with Bobby touring the USA with new wave pioneers The X-Statics. DeVito was able to fulfill his synthesizer jones during these years by toying with lead vocalist/keyboardist Jon Allmightey's analog synths during rehearsals and soundchecks. After seven years of constant touring and performance, the band split up and Bobby headed to South Florida for an unknown musical future.\n\nGathering together a drum machine, 4 track recorded, and some signal processing gear, Bobby recorded his first album \"Guitar Salad\" during this era. This album was more successful than anything he had done previously, being featured on mainstream radio stations all over Florida and garnering a fair amount of press attention. This project set Bobby upon the solo artist path that he has pursued ever since. It was also during this time that academia beckoned, and DeVito managed to get into the prestigious IDS program at St. Petersburg Junior College. After graduating from SPJC, he set his sights on the progressive honors university New College in Sarasota Florida. After making it through the gauntlet of admissions tests and interviews, DeVito was accepted and began to work intensely with Professor Steven Miles, the director of the music program for the college. Miles was a huge influence on the budding electronic music composer, exposing Bobby to a world of sounds, textures, sociological theory, and music history. It was also beneficial that New College had just built an electronic music studio the year DeVito started his studies, as well as hiring an electronic music professor from the Eastman School of Music, Robert Constable. The electronic odyssey had begun. At New College Bobby was exposed to the music and compositional thoughts of composers such as John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Milton Babbitt, and Iannis Xenakis, as well as philosophers of music such as Walter Benjamin, Simon Frith, and Theodor Adorno. This learning experience helped DeVito to develop his compositional skills and theories, as well as gather an appreciation of electronic music history and conceptual framework.\n\nDuring these halcyon college days, DeVito managed to secure a job working for BMG Distribution as their College Marketing Rep, a position he held for three years that allowed him to get \"real-world\" experience in the music industry. At New College, each student must write a Master's Thesis in order to graduate, and Bobby decided on an ambitious project -- to combine his written thesis with a full length album of ambient music. Starting with Erik Satie, and ending up with modern day composers such as Aphex Twin, DeVito's thesis covers the dawn and progression of ambient music, the ways ambient music is distinguished from Muzak, and the sociological implications of ambient music listener reception by touching on the theories of philosopher Theodor Adorno. DeVito's thesis lives on in Hyperreal's \"Epsilon Ambient Music Archive\".\n\nThe CD portion of his thesis is entitled LVX Nova. This project was a collaboration between DeVito and noted electronic composer Mike Meengs. The thesis project was a success, and DeVito graduated from New College in 1996.\n\nAfter graduation, DeVito set out to get the project released commercially. After releasing the album independently and garnering over 60 pages of press worldwide, three labels presented offers to release the album: R? Records in Belgium, Subharmonic Records in NYC, and MIRAMAR Records in Seattle. After entertaining all the offers, DeVito decided to sign with MIRAMAR, home to one of his biggest influences Tangerine Dream, and also a part of the BMG Distribution family. LVX Nova received tons of press, critical accolades, and made it to several \"top ten releases\" lists. In addition, the CD won several awards, including the 1999 \"JAMMY\" award in Florida for best electronic act.\n\nHowever, with the instability of MIRAMAR after motion picture company UNAPIX bought out the label in 1999, DeVito was again without a label. After doing some international touring with Atlantic/Code Blue recording artist Sherman Robertson (as bandleader and second guitarist) DeVito once again plunged into the electronic abyss. Stargarden was born at this time. The name stargarden is directly influenced by the underwater life of starfish, who can form huge colonies on the sea floors in a communal form -- sadly, unlike their human counterparts.\n\nHoled up in a loft in Hyde Park Tampa, and later Miami Florida, DeVito creates music entirely for the sake of the process and the enjoyment of his fans. Relying on timbre, repetition, and space, the music of stargarden ranges from drifting ambient space music to beat driven electronica. Bobby cites other artists such as Tangerine Dream, Aphex Twin, Brian Eno, Global Communication, Peter Namlook and FAX artists, John Cage as influences on his particular brand of ambient music. After discovering the then-fledgling MP3.com from his friend. sometime musical partner, and influence Mike Meengs, DeVito placed the first stargarden album on MP3.com, and received thousands and thousand of downloads, as well as quite a few CD sales.\n\nNow, in order to bring electronic music distribution to a new level, DeVito has signed stargarden with Magnatune, believing in their new model of music distribution and intellectual property management. And with new music being released only here on Magnatune, the future of stargarden ambient music is secure.\n\nIf you like this music, please consider buying a CD or two to help the process continue. The quest for ambient beauty continues....." .

His meditative compositions are a seamless, soothing blend of harmonic and acoustic channels, played on an ever-changing lineup of instruments including didgeridoo, djembe, and talking drum, as well as the gopichand, udu, and hulusi?a Chinese bamboo woodwind dating back to the time of Buddha.\n\nChristopher began crafting his distinctive form of playing over ten years ago in Portland, Oregon, where he took an African drumming class for fun and discovered he not only enjoyed it, but had a talent for it as well. Gradually over the years, he began adding instruments such as the djembe (African hand drum) and didgeridoo to his repertoire, first playing them individually, and eventually mastering the art of simultaneous playing. These days, he's been known to play up to five or six instruments at a time during live performances?each one from a from different musical tradition or region of the world. The resulting sound is timeless and universal, yet also deeply warm and resonant, and has been described the ideal accompaniment to meditation, relaxation, yoga, and massage, as well as just listening.\n\nChristopher's most recent album, Spheres, combines 22 different instruments from around the world for a mesmerizing blend of acoustic drone, rhythm, and melody. It also includes a few choice selections from Christopher's popular street show, which he has performed in more than 14 countries.\n\nSays Christopher, \"When I see a person stop in the middle of a bustling street in the midst of their busy day, and close their eyes and stop everything for even a few seconds, then I feel I am creating something of real value, and I feel satisfied.\"\n" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/lizzi> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "There's both longing and loneliness in Lizzi's dark, sensual voice. Love and chill -- like the icy winter winds sweeping across her native island of Gotland in Sweden. \"To be in love is a kind of isolation,\" she says. \"It's not all happiness and joy: there's a lot of pain and emptiness too. But longing is also an incredible feeling, much under-valued today.\"\n\nGrowing up in a poor music-loving family of six children, Lizzi knows all about longing. \"I was lucky,\" Lizzi says. \"I was on friendly terms with the preacher. He let me use the village church to sing whenever I wanted.\" The mental image of a little girl singing her heart out -- alone in a vast, empty church in the dark of night -- still resonates through one's mind when listening to Lizzi's music today.\n\nLizzi started singing professionally in the synth band Houses & Gardens. \"One of the band members heard me singing in the shower and thought I should have a go. Some of the other guys in the band thought I was too cheerful. I was prohibited to laugh during performances.\" She says synth-rock really wasn't her style but she did it because she loved to sing. \"And I've always been a chameleon. It's taken me a long time to find my own voice.\"\n\nIn 1994, she released her first solo album, \"Lizzie,\" for which she wrote most of the songs. \"But that wasn't really me either, even though I believed so at the time. It didn't take very long to find out...\"\n\nLater, she spent two years singing with the Swedish avant-garde group, The Flesh Quartet. Working in The Flesh Quartet brought her together with producer Jacob Hellner. After having turned down one record company who wanted to morph her into a Swedish Kylie Minogue(!), Lizzi and Jacob decided to make her new album on their own. \"I can't sell my soul. If I did I'd really be poor forever. I'd rather work petty day jobs as long as I can sing. Besides, I can only sing about things I've experienced - that's when it gets good.\"\n\nThe new album, \"Love and you and I,\" is about uniting opposites -- staying and walking away, sadness and happiness -- and musically uniting the coldness of loops and computers with the warmth of real instruments. \"The album is the story of a love affair -- from the beginning, through all the conflicting emotions to the not necessarily bitter end... Simplicity is the keyword, both musically and lyrically,\" Lizzi says.\n\nThough she left Gotland long ago, the magic island is still in her blood. \"When I sing my lyrics, it's as if I'm back there somehow. It's the same feeling I had when I lived there as a child -- the sunlight flooding sideways at dusk, like a flash of lightning racing through the landscape.\" Somehow, that feeling flows through her songs, too.\n\nUlf Ivarsson plays bass on Lizzi's \"Love and you and I,\" and also has a solo project on Magnatune under the name \"Beat Under Control.\"" .

Currently attending the University of Kansas studying Art History Drawing and Painting. I now live in Lawrence Kansas USA.\n\nI began playing at the age of five under the suzuki theory and continued with lessons until the age of 18 or so. I became bored with playing other peoples songs and the piano in general. I really started making a lot of progress when I got into improvising and composing my own pieces. This was around the age of 13 or 14.\n\nI recorded and released my first solo album at the age of 17. The Depths of a Year was written from the age of 18 to 19 while I first attended the University of Kansas. Much of the album came from a need to cope with a failed relationship. I wrote the album and called Kate who I barely knew. I did know she could play and she gladly joined on. I dropped out of school to play piano and organ with a rock and roll band called the gadjits ( now the architects) and a band called the belles. I toured for two and a half years, playing over 300 shows in all of north america and the UK.\n\nBeing burnt out by the road and rough lifestyle, I have happily returned to school to study visual arts and focus on my composing, drawing from the likes of Radiohead, Interpol, and many others. I am now 22 and hope to keep pushing the boundaries of my creativity and composing in general.\n" .

Formed in 2001, the band's unconventional hard rock combines melodic keyboard and vocals over complex rhythms and chords, creating a unique rock sound that is equally appropriate on the dance floor, car radio and mosh pit.\n\nTheir debut album, The Looking Glass (2004), co-produced by the band and veteran sound engineer Tony Van Hoorn (recorded Phil Ramone, Ray Charles, Rick Derringer, Southside Johnny) combines a surprising collection of tracks, each significantly different from the others.\n\nComprised of eight songs, The Looking Glass is infectious from the first song, The Order, to the last, Messenger.\n\nThe complex musical progressions in each song are complimented by lead singer John Penola's introspective, yet ambiguous lyrics.\n\nSwaying between kinetic choruses and somber verses, the album takes on the difficult task of pleasing both the hardest rocker and those who must find a melody and meaningful lyrics to appreciate a band's talents.\n\nThe four piece band is composed of singer/keyboardist John Penola; guitarist Tyler Bissell; drummer/vocalist Kurt Wubbenhorst and bassist Rob Struck." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/lara_st_john> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Described as \"something of a phenomenon\" by The Strad magazine and a \"high-powered soloist\" by the New York Times, Canadian-born violinist Lara St. John has performed as soloist with the Cleveland Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Toronto Symphony, the Montreal Symphony, the Franz Liszt Chamber Orchestra of Budapest, among many others, and given recitals around the world.\n\nThe Strad magazine selected her as one of \"the stars of the next decade\" and called her \"an electrifying player, as deeply satisfying in Bach as she is bewitchingly seductive in Waxman's 'Carmen' Fantasy. The L.A. Times has said: \"St. John brings to the stage personal charisma, an unflagging musical imagination and genuine passion. Her two albums to date are bona-fide classics of the violin discography.\"\n\nIn January 2002, Lara released her third CD on her own label. Bach: The Concerto Album and has received enthusiastic reviews. Gramophone Magazine placed the disc in its strongly recommended section, and wrote \"It is difficult to argue with such a technically dazzling and unfailingly musical interpretation.\"\n\nDuring 1999/2000 highlights included engagements with the National Arts Centre Orchestra, Seattle Symphony, Vancouver Symphony, Buffalo Philharmonic, Shanghai Broadcasting Symphony, and Edmonton Symphony, while the 2000/01 season brought her debuts with the New Jersey Symphony under Hugh Wolff, the Tokyo Symphony (Paavo Jarvi), Hong Kong Philharmonic, Honolulu Symphony, and Calgary Philharmonic, among others. During last season she debuted with the Cincinnati Symphony, Prague Philharmonia, Sao Paulo Symphony, Opera de Marseille and performs numerous other concerto appareances in Canada and the US, as well as recitals at Ravinia, the Miller Theater in New York, in Montreal, Quebec City, and throughout China. Season 2002/03 continues the array of appearances on the recital stage and as soloist with orchestra, among them the symphonies of Portland, Delaware, Knoxville, the Florida Orchestra, and Northwest Sinfonietta. In addition she will undertake a nation-wide recital tour under the auspices of Community Cocerts. Other future engagements include debuts at Tanglewood with the Boston Pops under Keith Lockhart and performances with the Vancouver Symphony, among others.\n\nShe has been victorious in several competitions and in 1997 won the use of the 1702 Lyall Stradivarius for two years from the Canada Council for the Arts and an anonymous donor. Upon hearing her audition, the panel of judges exclaimed, \"Today we have heard one of the great violinists of our time! Inspirational.\" Currently, she performs on the 1779 \"Salabue\" Guadagnini thanks to an anonymous donor and Heinl & Co., Toronto.\n\nLara began playing the violin when she was 2 years old. She first soloed with orchestra at age 5, and made her European debut with the Gulbenkian Orchestra (Lisbon) five years later. She toured Spain, France, Portugal and Hungary at ages 12 and 13, entered the Curtis Institute at 14, and spent her first summer at Marlboro three years later.\n\nUpon her graduation from Curtis, at age 17, Lara took off for Moscow to find out if there was really more to life than just music --- there was. At this time, most teachers at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory (including hers) were indefinitely extending their journeys west, and being without a teacher for the first time gave her the opportunity to travel extensively throughout the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. She also spent two years in England at the Guildhall school, holds a certificate from the Mannes College in New York City, and an Artist's Diploma from the New England Conservatory in Boston. Her teachers over the years have included Linda Cerone, David Takeno, Arnold Steinhardt, Felix Galimir and Joey Corpus.\n\nLara is a great fan of J.R.R. Tolkien, reptiles, and the American Museum of Natural History. She resides in New York City." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/briddes_roune> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "The name Briddes Roune (BREE-dess RONE) is Middle English for bird song/conversation/speech and is a reference to the fact that two of the three of us are named Robin. I formed Briddes Roune specifically to record early medieval English songs, a repertoire I have been singing for several years. As anyone who's read Chaucer aloud knows, Middle English has a delightfully musical lilt, making it a fun language to sing, and the English fondness for thirds and sixths gives the music a sweetness that is unusual for that time.\n\nThis recording includes the songs of St. Godric, who claimed that all of his songs came to him in visions. For example, during a vision in which he saw Mary Magdalene and the Virgin Mary, the Virgin taught him \"Sainte Marie viergene,\" saying that if he found himself in pain or tired or succumbing to temptation, he should sing this song and she would come quickly to his aid. Godric died in 1170, making these songs the earliest songs in English with extant melodies. More on St. Godric can be found in the liner notes.\n\nI am particularly drawn to the songs without fixed rhythms. The rhythms of songs such as \"Stond wel, moder, under roode\" and \"Ar ne kuth, ich sorghe non\" are driven by the speaking rhythms of the words and by musical intuition. I like the improvised quality of these songs, and I enjoy the extra opportunity to express the text.\n\nPerforming medieval music involves some challenges not faced by those interested in later music. Instrumental accompaniments were almost never written down, and even the choice of instruments used was quite free. What you hear on this recording is very much our own arrangement. Our instrumental parts arise from a combination of planning and improvisation. Instrumental countermelodies are generally written out in advance by either Kathryn or myself. Drone parts are generally worked out in rehearsal. The process goes something like this:\n\nKathryn: How about this?\nRobin S.: ...mmm...no...maybe an A?...no...a D?...no....\nKathryn: What about this?\nRobin S: Yeah, that's best.\nKathryn: That's what I played originally.\n\nAll instrumental preludes and interludes are improvised.\n\nIn addition to the challenge of writing our own instrumental parts, very few English songs have survived with their melodies, although we have many lyrics. For the surviving melodies, I have used E.J. Dobson and F. Ll. Harrison's book, Medieval English Songs. For others (e.g. Lenten is come, Lutel wot hit any mon), I have set lyrics in the style of that time and place. I typically start by choosing a mode, which defines what notes are in the scale and which are most important, and then I start playing with the words, improvising tunes. When I get a fragment that I like, I write it down, and gradually the piece begins to take shape." .

He steadily built up a collection of instruments, and continued honing his sound?one built around the visual and emotive powers of electronic music.\n\n\"Electronic music and synthesisers always had an ability to draw and conjure images, sensations and emotions within me. I have always thought that Klaus Schulze's title Picture Music summed up the genre pretty succinctly. I don't really spend time trying to work out whether Etherfysh fits into a particular musical box. I would much rather my listeners draw their own conclusions on that one.\"\n\nFor Etherfysh, 2005 saw collaborations with with Dutch EM artist Gert Emmens, as well as the release of Stasis, a work of hypnotic melodies wrapped around subtle, silvery beats.\n\nEtherfysh's other releases include Musick in the Quay of Sea, A Box of Fysh, and Pandora's Box." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/mijo> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Mijo (AKA Michel Jordan) began his musical adventures on flute and piano at the tender age of 8. By age 11 he had branched out into woodwinds, playing alto sax in the school orchestra until the fateful day in 1977 when his family moved to Germany and he was forced to leave the saxophone behind.\n\nLuckily, this did not spell the end of his career - upon arriving in Germany, he promptly put his talents to good use on a Gibson western guitar, expanding his repertoire with lessons and collaborations with Thomas Reuther, who went on to become a noted classical guitarist in his own right.\n\nThe two went on to eventually form the Turkish/Oriental fusion band 'Grup Fakir', with several other musicians, and received critical acclaim and an offer to tour Turkey in the mid-1990's. Unfortunately the band dissolved shortly after recording their first demo cd, but Thomas and Michel continued their forays, delving into musical motifs that firmly straddled Greek and Turkish origins.\n\nIn 1995 Michel met new cohorts, Christian Wolff and Michael Fey, who he went on to produce and perform live soundscapes and themes to Fachhochschule - Frankfurt theatres production of Shakespeares' 'Midsummer Nights Dream' and 'Macbeth'. Again, his efforts met with resounding success, both personally and publicly.\n\nMichel and Christian went on to form the experimental acoustic/electro-fusion/jazz/techno/blues-rock band 'Ultraschall', playing on a weekly basis with guest artists from around the world, including Christian Schmidhofer of Embryo.\n\nIn 1999, Jordan and Fey teamed up, under the Sensor II moniker, to produce some new tracks with a more electronic edge, cuts of which rose to the top of the charts on Garageband.com and were included on the Garageband 'Best of Electronica' compilation CD. It was through Garageband that Artemis connected with Jordan to eventually produce the track 'Hypno' on Artemis' latest release 'Gravity'.\n\n'Fata Morgana' is Jordan's latest effort, a sensual trip that beats a path across time and genre, melding the past, present and future sounds of world music." .

Concert tours have taken him throughout Europe and North America with featured appearances at the Mostly Mozart Festival in New York, the Musikverein in Vienna, Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, Carnegie Hall, Royal Albert Hall in London, Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, Gottingen International Handel Festival, Library of Congress in Washington D.C., Tage Alter Musik Festival, Regensburg, Berkeley Early Music Festival, Monadnock Music, J. Paul Getty Museum Summer Series, San Luis Obispo Mozart Festival, San Jose Chamber Music Society, and the Nakamichi Early Music Festival.\n\nA graduate of the Royal Conservatory of Music in Holland, Schultz also holds several degrees from the California Institute of the Arts and the California State University of San Francisco. Currently he is an Associate Teaching Professor in Music History and Flute at Carnegie Mellon University and director of the Carnegie Mellon Baroque Orchestra. Schultz's engaging teaching style has left its mark at California State University at Long Beach and Sacramento, the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, Holy Names College, the University of Southern California, and the University of California at Davis and Los Angeles. Mr. Schultz is also a featured faculty member of the Jeanne Baxtresser International Flute Master Class at Carnegie Mellon University and at the International Baroque Institute at Longy School of Music.\n\nIn 1986, Mr. Schultz founded the original instrument ensemble, American Baroque. This unique group brings together some of America's most accomplished and exciting baroque instrumentalists, with the purpose of defining a new, modern genre for historical instruments. The group's adventurous programs combine 18th-century music with new works, composed for the group through collaborations and commissions from American composers. Collaborations with such artists and composers as Rudy Rucker, Jonathan Berger, Carl Stone, and the Common Sense Composers Collective yielded an unprecented number of commissioned works written specifically for the group's instruments. The ensemble remains the only U.S. chamber ensemble committed to performing both new music and 18th-century works on historical instruments, while continuing to explore the issues raised by both genres, old and new.\n\nAs solo, chamber, and orchestral player, Schultz appears on nearly fifty recordings for such labels as Dorian, Naxos, Harmonia Mundi USA, New Albion, Amon Ra, and Koch International Classics. Schultz has produced and edited forty CDs for his colleagues and has also performed and recorded with world music groups such as D'CuCKOO and Haunted By Waters, using his electronically processed Baroque flute to develop alternative sounds that are unique to his instrument. In 2006, the Pittsburgh composer Nancy Galbraith wrote Traverso Mistico for Mr. Schultz. It is scored for electric Baroque flute, solo cello, and chamber orchestra and was given its world premiere at Carnegie Mellon University in April 2006.\n\nElizabeth Blumenstock is one of the country's leading baroque violinists. A frequent soloist, concertmaster, and leader with Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra, Los Angeles-based Musica Angelica, American Bach Soloists, Chicago Opera Theater, and the Italian ensemble, Il Complesso Barocco, she is also a member of several of California's finest period instrument chamber ensembles, including Musica Pacifica, the Arcadian Academy, American Baroque, Trio Galanterie, and Trio Galatea. Ms. Blumenstock is Resident Artistic Director of Musica Angelica's chamber music series. With over 90 recordings to her credit, she has recorded for Dorian, harmonia mundi, Virgin Classics, BMG, Reference Recordings, Koch International, Sony, and New Albion.\n\nMs. Blumenstock has appeared with period orchestras and chamber ensembles throughout the United States and abroad, and has performed at the Boston and Berkeley Early Music Festivals, the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival, Los Angeles Opera, the Carmel Bach Festival, and the San Luis Obispo Mozart Festival, among others. She is instructor of baroque violin at the University of Southern California and teaches regularly at the International Baroque Institute at Longy in Cambridge, MA. Ms. Blumenstock is also organist/choir director at Holy Trinity Episcopal Church in Richmond, CA, and is an avid Scrabble and pinball player." .

His long list of influences range from Spiritualized to The Flaming Lips, and underground artists such as Fourtet, Bedhead, and Marumari.\n\nHis debut CD is being embraced by college radio, the underground press, and fans who long for music with a subtlety and depth often lacking in both mainstream and indie music.\n\nAlthough the CD's title hints at a political message or philosophical statement, Wade is characteristically understated on the subject. \"I'm not really sure what the world is all about, but I'm willing to accept that and just try to be good to folks and create music that they might like.\"\n\nWhether it is something spiritual, political, or simply human emotion you seek, the best way to learn the truth about Wade Williamson is to put on his CD, close your eyes, and enjoy." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/yoria> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Arthur Yoria is one of those musicians that have the rare ability to churn out one gem of a tune after another. His uncanny ear for melody, hooks, and arrangement is paralleled only by his captivating voice which seems to carry the weight of a thousand break-ups, but somehow manages to soar effortlessly to a place where joy, goose bumps, and repeated listens are unavoidable. Built on beefy rhythms, unforgettable riffs and clever lyrics that can quickly go from touching to venomous, Arthur's songs are models of contemporary pop song craft.\n\nAfter stints in the Houston based bands, The Jeepneys and Lavendula, Arthur decided to set out on his own and released a self-titled EP in 2001 to much critical acclaim as well as some interest from various major labels. With a solid backing band and a commitment to play live as often as possible, the end of the year brought with it a nomination in the Houston Press Music Awards \"Best New Act\" category and a management deal with Los Angeles based Kio Novina Management (Tenacious D, Sugarcult, Actual Tigers).\n\nFollowing the release of another critically acclaimed EP, can you still look adorable in 2002, Arthur and good friend, former Houston Rocket, Matt Maloney began talking about forming a record label for the purposes of releasing a full-length CD. Two years, a few SXSW showcases, maybe the most nominations for a single artist in the Houston Press Music Awards (for the past three years) and several drunken conversations about the state of the music industry later, Matt and Arthur have finally made good on their plans.\n\nI'll Be Here Awake is Arthur Yoria's debut full-length, self-released album. A stunning achievement, this album shows the Houston based, Chicago native at the apex of his talents. From beginning to end, this 37 and-a-half minute concept pop/rock masterpiece delivers one swift kick after another while leaving imprints, not soon erased of it's well-crafted melodies, undeniable hooks and raw emotions. One of those rare releases that not only wins over the reluctant music snob, but gets the reluctant music snob's grandmother humming; I'll Be Here Awake is that CD that becomes more reliable than your best friend.\n\n\"I just wanted to make a very simple and to the point, rock record about this very nasty and egotistical fictional character that I vicariously live through from time to time,\" Arthur says, \"I went easy on the overdubs after the basic tracks were on tape in order to avoid making the big and lush, singer-songwriter-type record that I was supposed to make and unlike a lot of past studio experiences, I ended up having the time of my life in there. I just hope that the playful atmosphere as well as the contrast between that atmosphere and the sometimes not-so-pleasant subject matter comes through when people listen to this thing.\"\n\nIan Varley plays in Arthur Yoria's live band and is the organist in Drop Trio, a groove-oriented organ-based funk jazz trio." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/mountain_mirrors> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Imagine Nick Drake, Pink Floyd, and Opeth jamming under a deep woods full moon, and you'll start to get a glimpse into Mountain Mirrors, the psych folk/rock project of multi-instrumentalist Jeff Sanders.\n\nSanders honed his guitar chops in the 80's jamming in metal/punk jam bands Shared Psychosis and Your Dirge, and blending original instrumental music with Black Sabbath, Metallica, and Slayer. As his tastes broadened, however, he began bringing in folk influences such as Nick Drake and Damien Rice, and creating the hypnotic folk-rock for which he is known today. It's this melodic yet mesmerizing sound that Sanders uses to explore issues of spirituality. Although his music expresses a deep yearning for enlightenment, it's Sanders' willingness to examine the eerie, lonely side of this quest that makes his music so powerful.\n\nThough these dark, even spooky influences are definitely felt throughout his work, Sanders' music also contains a deep vein of introspection that keep it from being menacing. One reviewer described the first Mountain Mirrors album, Lunar Ecstasy, as a work \"fit for poets, travelers and seekers,\" while another called it \"the perfect chill-out album with brief touches of Delerium, Alice in Chains, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Portishead and The Tea Party.\" In February 2004, Lunar Ecstasy was named album of the month by both IndieSoundz and StonedGods, and \"Afterlife\" was chosen by Indie Music Beat Magazine for their annual 101 Great New Music Tracks CD.\n\nThe eponymous Mountain Mirrors album is Sanders' second full length album, and shows a deepening mastery of his intense, supernatural sound. Guest musicians include Elad Fish on drums and piano, Claire Fitch on cello, Oren Selas on keyboards, and Guy Bar-Tor on bass. \"They're phenomenal, absolutely sent from heaven,\" says Sanders.\n\nSays The Sound Monitor of Mountain Mirrors, \"From atmospheric sounds to Massive Attack style trip-hop with your more standard acoustic guitar & soft singing tracks. The music takes you on numerous twists and turns throughout dark and beautiful landscapes from your dreams and nightmares.\"" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/falik> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "All that matters in the Falik experience is where the music takes you, and this music is definitely mobile. Falik infuses middle-eastern, Greek, Celtic, and Baltic folk elements with electronica; it is at once exotic and familiar. The songs have a raw, earthy quality, but are ebullient, exciting, and entirely engaging to the listener, with melodies that aim straight for your heart.\n\nFalik is Charlie Pecot, who has traveled an interesting and eclectic path. This music is definitely a \"snapshot\" that illustrates where he has been.\n\nFor Charlie - as it is for many people - music is a consolation, a stimulus that helps one to make peace with troubled thoughts. It vitalizes the spirit, recharges the will, and inspires the body and soul to movement and action. Charlie has always felt his life was somewhat \"charmed\" by music; that he feels elevated when he plays, more in tune with his surroundings like as if a cloud has lifted allowing the illumination of his true self. Sometimes his true self can be quite amusing.\n\nProfessionally, Charlie has always done what felt right and remains true to his own personal philosophies. Sometimes, this means eschewing possible commercial success in favor of artistic expression, but his goal is to bring to the forefront his brand of \"popular\" thematic art.\n\nCharlie has always been a fan of \"pop\" music, being influenced as a child by '60s blues, soul and rock groups that made their way into popular culture, and then later by English art/rock groups: Jumi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Sweat, Blood and Tears, Sly and the Family Stone, Led Zeppelin, Beatles, Rolling Stones, Kinks, The Who, Eric Clapton, Supertramp, Yes, David Bowie, Foghat, Genesis, Queen.\n\nIf anything, \"Falik\" is the result of Charlie's demented view of what he thinks is \"world fusion pop\". This is his attempt at combining everything he knows and appreciates about the music he loves and putting into a format that he feels people are already familiar with. Charlie is a big fan of dance music, and not just because he loves to dance. He loves the way that music can make you feel like dancing. This is the essence of what he tries to capture. He wants to invoke in the listener the desire to sway, shake, boogie, and groove - to delight in the joy of movement and self-expression. It may be interesting to note at this point that children have always responded favorably to Falik; they \"get\" him." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/kperl> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Katherine Roberts Perl began her harpsichord studies at the age of 14 and went on to study music at Los Angeles City College, Immaculate Heart College, and the San Francisco Conservatory of Music where she studied intensively with Laurette Goldberg and received her Master's Degree harpsichord performance. Since that time Perl has developed both a unique teaching and playing style for which she has become well known?one that celebrates the dynamic and expressive aspects of the harpsichord and is influenced by the American idioms of blues and jazz.\n\nWhile conventional ideas of the harpsichord hold that it does not allow for variation in volume, Perl's powerful playing overturns this perception, and mines the expressive capacity of the instrument. Her innovative approach has been termed \"sound sculpture.\"\n\nMs. Perl's first recording, Pieces de Clavecin, Music of Louis Couperin was nominated for Best Baroque Recording of French music in 1993, in Paris. The second recording, Music of Jacques Duphly, was released in 1998 on the Dorian label and most recently Perl's independent recording of four of Bach's French Suites has been made available on Magnatune. Bach's classic composition for harpsichord, The Well-Tempered Clavier, has now become the center of Perl's artistic attention and future recordings and releases are in the works.\n\nIn addition to her performing, teaching, and recording activities, Katherine Roberts Perl is an esteemed harpsichord technician, serving the Bay Area. She and her husband Mark produce a concert series/salon in their home in San Francisco called Chattanooga Chamber Music, which consists of four live music performances every fall and spring.\n\n\"I consider myself extremely fortunate that my life thus far has been contemporary with many great masters,\" says Perl, \"who have shown the way for practitioners of early music performance in my own generation and the next: musicians such as Gustav Leonhardt, the Kuijken brothers and Hopkinson Smith, to name a few.\" She adds, \"My mission in life is to play the music of Bach, Couperin and others on the harpsichord with clarity and grace, and to teach others what it takes to do so. Meaningful expression is an elusive thing, and so wondrous when it is achieved.\"\n\nAdditional Praise for Katherine Roberts Perl:\n\n\"The key to Roberts' success is her fluent but precise rhythmic sense. She has a way of springing the rhythm, drawing out the line, waiting until the last possible moment before attacking a note without damaging the onward flow in the slightest. Strength and delicacy, nuance and bite seemed available in abundance...a fluent but precise rhythmic sense.\" ?Charles Shere, Oakland Tribune\n\n\"She genuinely captured the essence of accurate, sensitive and stylistic French keyboard playing...the audience was enraptured...passion and fire.\" ?Ruta Bloomfield, Iowa city\n" .

He is also very good singer with very peculiar voice. His solo at\" O THEOTOKOS AND VIRGIN REJOYS\" is amazing and I'm sure this chant will melt your hart.\n\nDuring the centuries the specific style of singing was formed in Monastery of Kiev-Pechersk Lavra (don't mix up with Old Kiev Chants). The origin of Kiev-Pechersk Lavra singing is in XI century when inok Anthony, arrived from Aphona, founded the Kiev-Pechersk Monastery. Lavra's hymns organically synthesize Byzantine tradition and folk-singing culture of old Rus. Under the influence of south-Slavic tunes Larva's way of singing gained a power and became one of bright characteristics of Ancient Rus. There are only two Kiev-Pechersk chants on this CD (\"From My Youth\" and \"God With Us\") because there is another CD specially dedicated to traditional worship singing of Kiev-Pechersk Lavra. You can listen and buy this CD at www.cdbaby.com/anthology\n\nIn 1784, the Italian conductor and composer J.Sarti (1729-1802) visited Russia. He was so enraptured by Orthodox Church singing that he left Italy for Russia and till the end of his days he lived and worked there. He wrote many beautiful chants for Russian Church and one of this chant is represented on this CD (\" O THEOTOKOS AND VIRGIN)" .

She moved to Holland to study with the cellist Anner Bijlsma and in 1987 earned a soloist's diploma at the Royal Conservatory in The Hague. Inspired by Mr. Bijlsma, Tomkins became interested in the performance of music on original instruments. As a member of the Trio d'Amsterdam (with clarinetist Eric Hoeprich and fortepianist Stanley Hoogland), she made a New York debut at the Frick Collection, which was recorded for National Public Radio and also appeared in Lincoln Center's \"Great Performers\" series in 1996. The trio recorded a CD for Koch. She has performed and recorded with orchestras such as The Classical Band (Sony), La Petite Bande (Harmonia Mundi), La Stagione Frankfurt (Harmonia Mundi), the Netherland Bach Society, Ensemble Bouzignac (Vanguard) and L'Orchestre des Champs-Elysees under the direction of Philip Hereweghe (Harmonia Mundi).\n\nDuring the fourteen years Tanya Tomkins was living in Holland, she was primarily active as a chamber musician, performing throughout Europe and the United States to critical acclaim. For five years she played with the award-winning Euridice Quartet. The quartet recorded a CD of the string quartets by Ravel and Debussy (Vanguard). She has also recorded a CD of French Impressionist music with the Renoir Ensemble, a harp quintet specializing in 20th century music. She has performed with the Amsterdam-based SoLaRe String Trio throughout Europe, the U.S., and Israel.\n\nTomkins has been invited to play in many chamber music festivals throughout Europe and the U.S., including the Amsterdam Chamber Music Society, Rondje Romantiek and the Moab Chamber Music Festival in Utah. She has appeared as a chamber musician at the 92nd Street Y in New York and has played numerous times in the Concertgebouw Kleine Zaal as a recitalist and in chamber music concerts.\n\nShe is currently a member of the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra with whom she has appeared as a soloist, and she performs regularly with the American Bach Soloists. In 2001, she was the winner of the international Bodky Competition for Early Music Soloists. Currently, she is performing in recitals across the United States as the cellist in the Tomkins-Zivian Duo, a San Francisco chamber music ensemble specializing in music performed on period instruments.\n\nEric Zivian was born in Michigan and grew up in Toronto, Canada, where he attended the Royal Conservatory of Music. After receiving a diploma there, he left home at age 15 to attend the Curtis Institute of Music, where he received a Bachelor of Music degree. He went on to receive graduate degrees from the Juilliard School and the Yale School of Music. He studied piano with Marina Geringas, Gary Graffman and Peter Serkin. He attended the Tanglewood Music Center as a performer in 1988 and 1989, studying chamber music with Gilbert Kalish, Peter Serkin, Joel Krosnick, and others. He has won numerous prizes for young pianists, including the Charles Miller/Sergei Rachmaninoff Award upon graduation from the Curtis Institute of Music and the Grace B. Jackson Award for Outstanding Achievement and Notable Contributions to the Program as a Whole at the Tanglewood Music Festival.\n\nMr. Zivian has appeared as a soloist in Toronto, New York, Philadelphia, and the San Francisco Bay area. He has performed Mozart and Beethoven concertos with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and the Beethoven Triple Concerto with the Santa Rosa Symphony and the Festival Orchestra at \"Music in the Mountains\" in Grass Valley. Recently, he has begun performing on original instruments, and he owns two period fortepianos. He is a member of the Zivian-Tomkins Duo, a fortepiano-cello duo that has performed in San Francisco, San Diego, Seattle, San Rafael, Berkeley, Davis, Boston and Washington, D.C. He is also a member of the Left Coast Chamber Ensemble and has performed with the Empyrean Ensemble, Earplay, and Alternate Currents.

These are some of the most interesting players on the contemporary Swedish music scene.\n\nThe opening track \"Blue Lights\" shows some of the many varied influences that forms the basis of \"Beat under control\". Goran Kajfes plays the majestic theme and improvise together with Per Wiberg over Ulf Ivarssons basslines, that leads us through a musical landscape which incorporates sounds and beats associated with both Miles Davis (Bitches Brew era) and eastern music.\n\nKajfes appears again on the next track \"Sacred\" a pulsating piece of ambient electronica. The track also features Raymond Kings electrically fuelled cello harmonies.\n\n\"This is beat under control\"--the third track--is built around a hard driving beat in the Roni Size school of drum-n-bass. The melody that leaps with the first basstheme is played on a Augustus Pablo-inspired melody and shows Ulf Ivarssons influences from reggae music.\n\nThe next title \"Direction Dub\" goes more in the dub direction. The production of this modern dub track feature a melodic sound and Raymond King playing atmospheric cello parts over the almost minimalist beat anchored by heavy bass. George Nakas adds colour with his whammy bar guitar playing.\n\nTrumpet player Goran Kajfes returns for the fourteen minute long \"Speechless \", which mixes modern electronica with both funk (funkadelic meets DJ Shadow) and early underground electronic music (70's Tangerine Dream).\n\nAs with all B.U.C. compositions the music is built around the energic and imaginative bass playing,in this case strikingly simple repetitive synth bass lines.\n\nThe last track \"Saturn Blues\" is basically a modern funky blues with a beat. All musicians featured in this line up of Beat under control reappear in this final track.\n\nUlf Ivarsson plays bass on the album \"Love and you and I\" by Magnatune artist \"Lizzi\"." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/gleusteen> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Canadian born violinist, Kai Gleusteen, started learning the violin at the age of 5 in his native city, Calgary. Early on, Kai met with success in local, provincial, and national music competitions, in addition to receiving top academic awards. He spent the summers at Meadowmount in New York State, at the Aspen Festival, at the Banff School of Fine Arts, and at the Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, California, working with Ivan Galamian, Dorothy Delay, Stuart Canin, and Nathan Milstein. Winters were filled with skiing, badminton, music, and school.\n\nWith the desire of broadening his horizons, Kai chooses to balance his post-secondary education between academics and music. At the University of Michigan, he studied anthropology, geophysics, and philosophy. To his great fortune, he found there the person who would become his greatest inspiration on both a personal and musical level; his violin teacher, Camilla Wicks. After receiving a Master's Degree from Rice University, Kai moved to Europe to live in the heart of Western Culture. Paris and Prague were his bases for nine years, allowing him to develop and perform both as a soloist and leader of numerous orchestras. In the year 2000, Kai won the concertmaster position of the Orchestra 'del Gran Teatre del Liceu' and subsequently moved to Barcelona. In 2003, he formed his own chamber orchestra, the Kaimerata, and was appointed professor at the Escuela Superior de Musica de Catalunya. He continues to perform extensively as a soloist and a recitalist throughout Europe and North America. Kai plays on a violin made by J.B. Guadagnini in 1781.\n\nHaving performed her first recital at the age of twelve, it wasn't until the age of twenty, after two years of law school that Catherine decided to devote herself entirely to music. Taught by Colette Fernier, Monique Deschausse, Sergio Perticaroli, and encouraged by Franais-Reneuche, she received the highest distinction at both the Conservatory in Rouen and later at the Ecole Normale Alfred Cortot in Paris. Catherine was also awarded the Yvonne Lefevre Foundation Prize leading to television and radio broadcasts and concert engagements. Catherine chose to avoid the international competition circuit in favour of taking the time to study repertoire in its historical context. Being a great lover of nature, a fan of Marcel Proust and having spent many years in Normandy, she explores in depth the composers who were inspired by this region, such as Roussel, Debussy, and Saint-Saens. She deepens her understanding of Beethoven, Schumann and Brahms with numerous trips to Germany and her knowledge of the language and by reading Goethe and Heine. Her interpretation of Chopin is nourished by the time spent in Poland and a close examination of his letters.\n\nCatherine's approach to music is very much appreciated not only by solo piano audiences throughout Europe and North America but also by various renowned chamber musicians. She is regularly invited to perform in chamber music festivals throughout these countries and devotes a large part of her time to her duo with Kai Gleusteen and the Trio Liceu." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/junoon> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Junoon is the Urdu word for \"obsession\" and is also is one of South Asia's most popular rock bands. Based out of Karachi, Pakistan, Junoon was formed in 1990 by guitarist/songwriter/medical doctor Salman Ahmad. The band, described by its members as a \"Sufi rock band,\" is considered as one of the most successful in the history of South Asia.\n\nThe name \"Junoon\" came to lead guitarist Salman Ahmad in a dream. In the dream, his teacher was shaking him and saying, \"Tumhey mousiqui ka Junoon hai!\" (meaning \"You have an obsession for music!\"). Shortly thereafter, he formed Junoon with other two friends, Ali Azmat and Brian O'Connell.\n\nJunoon's cult following began with the band's album Talaash (\"the quest\"), and was expanded to a national then international following with releases such as Azadi (\"freedom\") and Inquilaab (\"revolution\").Junoon While most Pakistani performers relied on sampling and highly programmed synth pop, Junoon was one of the first in Pakistan that insisted on playing real, live music. Heavily influenced by rock bands like Led Zeppelin, Junoon aimed at combining loud guitar riffs with the epic tranquility of sufi poetry by the likes of Maulana Rumi, Allama Iqbal and Baba Bulleh Shah.\n\nSuccess came with its attendant challenges. As they tried to defy traditions in a conservative country like Pakistan, Junoon's politically influenced songs were often subject to censorship, which led to the eventual ban from all state run television and radio during the rule of former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.\n\nDespite these difficulties, in 1998, the band took both Pakistan and India by storm with their hit single \"Sayonee\" from the album Azadi (\"freedom\"), their tremendously successful fourth studio album, initially released by EMI. In 1999, Junoon released their fifth studio album Parvaaz (\"the flight\"), based on the poetry of Baba Bulleh Shah. Parvaaz was recorded and mixed at Abbey Road Studios in London and was hailed by critics as Junoon's finest work to date. Junoon won the award of \"Best International Group\" at the Channel V Music Awards in New Delhi, India in November 1999, where they peformed with Sting, Def Leppard, and Prodigy.\n\nIn 1999, UNESCO invited Junoon to perform at their Millennium Peace concert in Paris, which drew an audience of dignitaries from around the world including the heads of the European union and ambassadors from 170 countries. Junoon performed with an aim toward promoting peace and was apparently a hit among many present including Ray Charles, Lionel Richie, Dr. K.J. Yesudas, Montserrat Caballe, and Zubin Mehta. Famous actors Gregory Peck, Sidney Poitier, and Peter Ustinov were the masters of ceremony for the event. Junoon\n\nIn 2003, Salman Ahmad was appointed Goodwill Ambassador by the United Nations, attending a Special Session of the UN General Assembly. Following the 9/11 attacks, Junoon helped to organise a concert at the General Assembly on UN Day with Junoon performing at the actual Assembly Hall, the first such performance of its kind. They also released the single \"No More,\" a song which deals directly with the violence perpetrated on that day.\n\nJunoon is arguably the most successful Pakistani musical group in history and has toured extensively around the world, including a performance at the renowned European rock festival, Roskilde, in June 2000, where they shared the stage with Pearl Jam, Iron Maiden, Travis, and Queensryche.\n\nJunoon's controversial single \"Pappu Yaar\" is known for having shot to the #1 spot in Pakistan. In fact, Junoon's issue oriented music has also helped to keep spirits high amidst deepening social woes on the international stage. Songs like \"Jazba-E-Junoon,\" \"Sayonee,\" \"Talaash,\" \"Main kaun hun\" are issue oriented yet poetic and try to take a big picture view of humankind and its place in the world. As a result, Junoon is often mentioned in the same sphere as Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan or Lata Mangeshkar, yet this rather erudite side did not prevent it from captivating Pakistani youth for well over ten years.\n\nIn their career, Junoon is particularly proud of having played an active role in bringing the people of India and Pakistan together. When tensions were high after the nuclear explosions in 1998, Junoon's' single \"Yaaron yehi dosti hai\" was played enthusiastically across many music channels in India which also found a sizeable audience in Pakistan. Junoon's viewpoints on nuclear testing were even loud enough to reach the White House, and continue to find a foothold in the global exchange of ideas today.\n\nIn 2005, Brian O'Connell returned to his native New York. Pakistani musician Mekal Hassan and the band's producer John Alec have been playing bass guitar for live shows in his place. A reunion concert took place in Dubai, UAE in March 2006.Junoon" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/jeff_wahl> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Upon first listen to a recording of Solo Acoustic Guitarist, Jeff Wahl, you might think that it's a recording of several guitarists playing together at once. However, it's all just one guitar with no overdubs. Audiences who see Jeff play live are also often surprised to see one guitarist sitting on stage yet hear what sounds like 2 or 3 guitarists playing together. Often compared to guitarists such as Leo Kottke, Michael Hedges, Joe Pass, and Will Ackerman, Jeff's style ultimately is a blend of many styles that defies categorization. Jeff's live repertoire encompasses the genres of Folk, Jazz, New Age, Classical and even Indian Ragas.\n\n\"For me, the guitar has always been my therapist and counselor. Playing the guitar and writing music came to me mainly I think because I've had to go through a lot of hard times in my life completely alone. The guitar has always been there for me through it all and I can't imagine how difficult my life would be without it. The inspiration for all of my songs is always a particular emotion I'm experiencing. I usually compose with the guitar in altered tunings so that I can't analyze the sounds through traditional music theory. Although I have a degree in music composition, I find it much more satisfying and authentic to compose through intuition rather than relying on rules of theory. Composing in this way keeps me humble to what the instrument wants to say and helps with keeping my ego out of the way when I write music.\"\n\nJeff's music has been featured often on local and national public radio programs during the last several years. Upon release of his first CD, Guitarscapes in 1999, Jeff was named one of America's best undiscovered guitarists by Guitar 9 Record's online guitar magazine.\n\nJeff grew up on a farm on the eastern plains of Colorado. He played the piano and trombone before discovering his connection with the guitar. He has degrees in music composition and music education. Jeff currently resides in the beautiful city of Fort Collins, Colorado." .

Elements at Loop 10 was composed and recorded at Perez's San Antonio studios and features guest appearances by vocalist Holly Nelson, James Sidlo of Honey Barbera fame, as well as the blissed out guitar craft of Damian Rodriguez.\n\n\"The initial concept was to create an album that had recognizable pop, rock, and electronic elements, but was not anchored to the typical cut and paste format that have become redundant on our airwaves,\" explains Perez.\n\nPerez and Rodriguez' ongoing collaboration led the duo to explore different musical styles, an evolution most noticeable on their Magic Midsummer release, which they released under the name Mosaico.\n\n\"We had just finished Elements and we had already had several ideas for the Seventythree project, but like Elements it required a lot of attention,\" says Perez. \"Every sound and lyric had to be planned and manipulated in our studio. That's where the Mosaico project came in. We needed something raw, we needed the serendipity of rock and roll... with electronic instruments of course.\"\n\nWhether exploring the big electronic soundscapes of Elements and Seventythree or the more spontaneous sound of Magic Midsummer, Perez and Rodriguez consistently turn out darkly beautiful pop and electronic gems?the perfect soundtrack \"for whatever the night brings.\"" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/farallon> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "The Farallon Recorder Quartet gives inspiring performances of a vast and varied repertoire extending across time and genre. Bach and Gershwin, Ockeghem and Serocki; sedate, wild, sublime, cutting edge and traditional, Farallon Recorder Quartet does it all with style.\n\nFormed in 1996, the Farallon Recorder Quartet takes its name from the rugged Farallon Islands off the coast of San Francisco. The quartet applies extensive knowledge of performance practices to music from eleven centuries, reaching out to modern audiences in an accessible and exciting manner. Farallon has performed for the Phoenix Arizona Early Music Society, Bay Area Recorder Series, Atlanta Early Music Alliance, at the American Bach Soloists Summer Festival, and with world-renowned guest artist Marion Verbruggen. Farallon's debut CD, a collection of sacred and secular works by the 16th century composer Ludwig Senfl, was released January 21, 2005.\n\nFarallon Recorder Quartet performs on numerous types of recorder from renaissance to modern, from sopranino to contrabass, from 6 inches to 6 feet tall. Dutch recorder builder Adriana Breukink made a set of ten renaissance recorders especially for Farallon. The quartet performs all its renaissance music on these spectacular instruments, creating a warm and wondrous tone of beauty.\n\nWhile devoting much of their concert programs to renaissance and baroque music, Farallon Recorder Quartet is also active in performing 20th and 21st century music, both well established works, and newly composed pieces, some of which have been written for the ensemble." .

Though laced with a liberal dose of psychedelia, Sundowner always keeps the overall sound intensely modern.\n\n\"We must let sounds be what they are\", says founder Matt Morris. \"We want to continue to push the envelope and as much as possible, make music that inspires feelings of genuine awe.\"\n\nBecoming disgruntled with their home city's live venue cartel, the band decided to start their own regular live night. \"Attention All Shipping\" has become a vehicle for new bands from around the world to showcase their work.\n\nIn 2005 Sundowner recorded music for a number of film projects, including Splintered, a thriller being aired at Cannes.\n\n2007 saw the release of their self-titled debut album, Sundowner.

Inspired by peer-to-peer file sharing of music, he began releasing his incredibly catchy indie pop songs online in 2002 and has since developed a significant online fanbase that includes remixers, visual artists, and a host of others whom he regularly invites to participate directly in his projects.\n\nIn 2005 he released his fan-funded debut album, I Don't Know What I'm Doing as well as its complete audio source. The self-produced 12 song set has been compared to Beck, Moby, Folk Implosion, and John Vanderslice and received a great deal of college and commercial airplay all over the world, including Australia, the UK, and the Caribbean.The music has been licensed by VH1, as well as several radio and television commercials. In 2007 a double album of remixes of I Don't Know What I'm Doing was released on Magnatune, featuring many of ccMixter's most popular remixers.\n\nSince Brad was one of the first to make the decision to release his music under a Creative Commons license, he was free to promote it through sites such as Magnatune, ccMixter, and the Podsafe Music Network, and he received a significant amount of publicity through blogs and interviews in free culture magazines such as Red Hat Magazine. Brad has also been featured in Maxim, The Seattle Times, NPR's All Songs Considerd, Flak Magazine, The Economist, and the Toronto Star, among many other publications.\n\nBrad is currently working on his second full length album, Out of It, and recently solicited \"community backup vocals\" for the title track. In addition to writing and recording music, Turcotte also runs the website stripcreator.com, which allows participants to create their own talking-head webcomics. He is also the creator of in4mador." .

By delving into the very depths of Renaissance culture their semi-staged performances unearth the archetypal and timeless quality of this music. Hannah Morrison's pure and sweet voice combined with the lilting citterns, gitterns, lutes, and flutes of Dominik Schneider and Mark Wheeler bring to life the passionate music of a distant age.\n\nPantagruel, the hero of a 1532 novel by Francois Rabelais, maintained the motto \"do, what thou wilt,\" and is a fitting name for an ensemble dedicated to exploring innovative methods of performance and presentation. Combining painstaking musicological research with their experience in classical music, rock, jazz, theater, and dance, Pantagruel's performances push the envelop of classical concert conventions by using Renaissance practices of medley, improvisation, and gesture.\n\nRecent Pantagruel performances have included concerts at the National Portrait Gallery in London, the Utrecht Early Music Festival, Munster Baroque festival, and collaboration with Andrew Lawrence-King (Harp Consort, Hesperion XX).\n\nTheir debut CD Elizium breaks boundaries to produce an album of painstaking authenticity, with a structure and intensity that bears comparison with the concept albums of 70's rock bands such as Pink Floyd. Elizium is set in Elizabethan England at the court of the Faerie Queene Elizabeth I, whose influence in modern pop culture can be seen in Tolkiens' Elven Queen Galadriel.\n\nArtist Bios\n\nHannah Morrison (Voyce) The daughter of Scottish and Icelandic musicians, it was in the Netherlands at the Musikhochschule Maastricht that she gained her BA, studying with the soprano Barbara Schlick. She has received further inspiration during master classes with Anthony Rooley, Evelyn Tubb and Andrew Lawrence- King.\n\nDominik Schneider (Flutes, Gittern & Voyce) From an early age he began to play every instrument he could get his hands on, but finally ended up studying the recorder at the Folkwang Musikhochschule in Essen and later renaissance and baroque traverse flutes at the Cologne Musikhochschule.\n\nMark Wheeler (Lutes, Cittern & Gittern) Born in Wordsley/England, he discovered his passion for plucked string instruments while listening to Led Zeppelin. His lute studies with Nigel North at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama in London have been complemented by master classes, with amongst others Jakob Lindberg & Julian Bream." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/clayne> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "c.layne started out with indie rock band The Na?ve, but soon went on to writing solo work. His limited-release first album, Albumone, was entirely instrumental.\n\nHe spent the next two years writing a second album and recording hundreds of tracks, but they were ultimately scrapped in favor of another album entirely. Antonymic was recorded over a four day period in the summer of 2003. The mid-fi recording and lavish use of reverb gives this album a modern psychedelic feel. Work on the next album began almost immediately and Drawing Shapes with Sounds, was released later that year. This album explores much darker musical and lyrical themes.\n\nIn the winter of 2003, c.layne signed with Magnatune and compilation album, Potemkin Villages was released featuring a mixture of tracks from both Antonymic and Drawing Shapes with Sounds, as well as some new material.\n\nIn the early months of 2004, c.layne paired up with artist and producer Victor Stone of fourstones.net to produce his third album, The Sun Will Come Out to Blind You. Writing, recording and production went on throughout the year and the album was released on Magnatune in January of 2005. Stones' production gave the album a slicker, slightly more downtempo finish to this album? one that is meant to be listened to at night." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/mediva> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Mediva is an outstanding medieval group made up of a flexible number of singers and multi-instrumentalists drawn from the leading exponents in their fields throughout Europe. Concerts feature a mix of exotic medieval and Arabian instruments such as oud, saz, shawms, recorders, harp, psaltery, fiddle and percussion as well as a range of singing techniques to suit each repertoire.\n\nCombining slick playing with unusual visual presentation, Mediva creates an experience that is more than just a concert. Full of verve and dynamism, the enjoyment the musicians have on stage is infectious! In addition to Mediva's fresh approach to music making, concerts are often enhanced with dance, poetry, projections and special lighting as well.\n\nAlthough individual members are steeped in the early music tradition, having trained at the Royal Academy of Music, Royal College of Music, Guildhall School of Music and Drama and Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, Switzerland, Mediva has developed a new way to perform medieval music. Rather than trying to recreate the past, performances use medieval music as inspiration for a new sound world and concert experience, relying heavily on improvisation. The group also experiments with modern composition, specially commissioned for the ensemble and works with funk, rock and world musicians for several cross-over projects.\n\nMediva burst upon the early music scene in October 1998 with an outstanding concert as part of the Radio 3 Early Music Day at the Royal Academy of Music. The group is a frequent guest on Radio 4's 'Loose Ends' and have been featured on Radio 3's 'In Tune' and 'Late Junction' and Early Music Show. They made their international debut in 2001 giving a series of concerts at the Barcelona Early Music Festival and were finalists in the International Young Artists Competition at the York Early Music Festival. They were also invited to be guest artists at the Sommer Kurs fur Musik des Mittelalters at the world renowned Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, Switzerland." .

It was formed by these talented musicians out of passionate dedication to the style and professional performance of specific types of music of the baroque and classical eras.\n\nThe Nova Casa play a broad and varied repertoire of music from these eras, executed on period instruments with full respect for the historical performance style. All the musicians possess a rich concert experience, both at home an abroad, which enables free interpretation of the music they play. The members of Nova Casa try to introduce their audience to the abundance of the Baroque music with its variety and scope. The ensemble also occasionally delves into other musical idioms from such countries as France, Italy, and Germany which provides a large context for their baroque and classical selections.\n\nThe Nova Casa ensemble also offers in its programme works by Adam Jarzebski (1590-1648), Marcin Mielczewski (1600-1651) and Stanislaw Sylwester Szarzynski (ca.1700), showing Polish baroque music within the context of stylistic achievements of European music of these days.\n\nRecent performances by Nova Casa include the Huygens Museum in The Hague (4 october 2006) and the ensemble also participated in Van Wassenaer Concours and Festival. Nova Casa has also performed during a Polish Radio broadcast from the ceremony mass at the Evangelical-Reformed Church in Warsaw as well as a concert of Italian baroque music in the Church for Artistic Milieux in Warsaw. At present, the ensemble performs at: XVII Early Music Festival in Warsaw, the \"Cruciixus Est\" Festival in Warsaw, and at the Wawel Royal Castle in Cracow.\n\nNova Casa ensemble members include Ewa Mrowca, Agnieszka Rychlik, Maria Papuzinska-Uss, Jakub Kosciukiewicz and Anton Birula.The name of the ensemble (Nova Casa) comes from the title of the pieces by Adam Jarzebski (1590-1648)?acomposer, poet and architect of the Ujazdowski Castle in Warsaw." .

They had met drummer Nick T. through a mutual friend, and later acquired Marvin S. (through Nick.)\n\nFor about one year the 4 \"jammed\" and wrote some songs, and decided to get serious. The first show played was an instrumental set at a High School Talent Show. Performing their songs Bloody Mary, and Apocalyptica. Though they aren't the most original names, the songs created a very positive response from the audience. Shortly thereafter the band auditioned Jeff Hayward.\n\nIt was with this line-up that the band began writing more songs, and began performing shows. Frequenting at clubs like Traditions (Ridgewood,Queens), and Voodoo Lounge (Bayside, Queens). In mid 1999, the band and Jeff H. decided to part ways, due to creative differences.\n\nIn addition to Jeff leaving the band, Dani (who played guitars at the time) had began going to school in Boston, Ma. With only one guitarist at hand the group had began \"auditioning\" guitarist, and found Ian S. With a rather quick decision, the band decided to take Ian.\n\nWhen Dani came back he took the position of vocals, and keyboards. Since this time, the band has recorded a full length album. Have gotten many positive reviews (from the promos sent out), had the opportunity to take many interviews. and have promoted themselves by playing some great venues" .

This is ensemble playing of great mutual respect and undeniable musicality.\"??Alex Baran, WholeNote Magazine, February 2006\n\nKnown for an inspired synthesis of French and Italian styles, Musica Franca is dedicated to performing the lush compositions written for bassoon and continuo during the baroque period?in particular the work of composers Michel Corrette and Joseph Bodin de Boismortier.\n\nCorrette and Boismortier lived during one of France's most politically turbulent times, but each wrote deeply warm, genial music. Musica Franca easily captures the playful, inventive spirit of Corrette's compositions, with many of the movements displaying the all-or-nothing passion that characterized much of his work. The Boismortier sonatas, by contrast, are treated with infinite subtlety and feline grace?played by Musica Franca with the utmost virtuosity that his work demands. The performances, in fact?with their infinite variations and nuances?reveal the skills that allowed Boismortier to become one of the first composers to succeed without a patron...able to make his living entirely by writing new works of music.\n\nThrough careful selection of the most interesting pieces by these composers, Musica Franca offers a fresh, charismatic perspective on their work. Instrumentation is varied ? sometimes even within the same piece ? in order to bring out the widest range of tonal colors, and Musica Franca performs the music in the same spirit of pleasure as many musicians of the 18th century: light, nimble interpretations performed with both nuance and joy.\n\nThe founding members of Musica Franca (pictured above left to right) are Mathieu Lussier, basssoon; Nadina Mackie Jackson, bassoon; and Fraser Jackson, contrabassoon." .

While Bell played piano and more classical big band instruments, Mr. Dz played guitar, drums and auxiliary percussion.\n\nIt wasn't until both went away to college that they discovered their love for electronic music could be translated into producing it. Bands and DJ's like Prodigy, Aphrodite, Andy C, Seb Fontaine, and Chemical Bros. influenced them while they struggled with a deep need to change that music and manipulate it.\n\nTheir journey to make something better began in 1999. Both Mike and Mike stopped experimenting and started producing on ghetto equipment. In 2001 the Wicked Allstars were born in the basement of a duplex just outside of Boston.\n\nWith pipes actually dripping water directly onto their equipment they created their first two songs that summer. \"Forgiven\" is a trip hop song with electric guitar, and \"Trouble-Remix\" is a remix of the Coldplay song \"Trouble\".\n\nSince then, with long periods of school separating them, they have gotten together and finished their first CD. The Wicked Allstars influences include Jay-Z, Tool, Wu-Tang, Basement Jaxx, Ben Folds, Hed-PE, Megadeth, Aaliyah, and TIMBALAND. (the list goes on)" .

Its various prizes include BBC Radio 3 Young Artists' Forum and the Byrne Award, given by the Handel Institute for Handel scholarship.\n\nIt was formed in 1995 by the baroque cellist Tatty Theo with the aim of exploring lesser-known works by Handel and his English and European contemporaries, and interpreting more familiar works in the light of recent scholarship. The Brook Street Band performs small to large scale repertoire ranging from intimate chamber music to concerts with double orchestra and choir.\n\nThe Brook Street Band has performed extensively at Festivals around Britain, including teaching and performing residencies at the Dartington International Summer School. The Band also gives concerts and runs education projects for the Handel House Museum in London.\n\nThe Brook Street Band also believes in commissioning contemporary works for period instruments. Those who have written for the group include the celebrated composer and educationalist David Bedford and renowned composer and vocalist Errollyn Wallen. One of the Band's most notable contemporary projects has been working with Errollyn on a song cycle The Queen and I, initiated for 2003 in anticipation of the 400th anniversary of the death of Elizabeth I." .

He remembers an early affinity for music and rhythm, but didn't begin playing until rather late in life at 17 when he found an old guitar belonging to his sister in the basement of the house they lived in. The guitar had only the three treble strings. Still, this was more than enough to work with. \"The first chord I ever learned was a D chord and I think it was because the guitar only had those three strings\".\n\nA Segovia cassette was another inspiration. \"Finding a Segovia album in post-revolution Iran was not at all impossible, however to me it was more than a call to the understanding of the guitar. It was a call to the understanding of music itself. I realized that the guitar wasn't the instrument, but that music was, and the guitar was simply a tool for the instrument of Music.\"\n\nUpon arriving to the United States Reza enrolled in Los Angeles Valley College. Throughout his attendance there he held first chair in both the LAVC Guitar Ensemble and the Monarch Guitar Quartet, an extension of the guitar department headed by Robert G. Mayeur. \"Performing (solos) was a great lesson for me. Knowing that I had nothing but the music to play allowed me to forget that I was all alone up there.\"\n\nHis musical experiences are wide and varied. \"I wanted to be a great guitar player, but more than that I wanted to be a great musician. And so music in all its forms became appealing to me. I thank my sister for leaving me that old guitar with three strings, and the Creator for blessing my ears. I sometimes wonder what might have happened had it been a didgeridoo.\"\n\nReza's album 'ReStrung' is a collection of original songs that he has been \"re-creating\" for the past ten years. He has been heard to call them practice pieces. \"On most of the songs on 'ReStrung' what you hear, minus the percussion, is one guitar track. So all these songs can be performed as solos. However, they would all work nicely as duets, or even trios and quartets.\"\n\nReza currently resides in North Hollywood, California." .

The instrument's trapezoid shape and distinctive sound?which comes from playing the instrument with two hand-held hammers?have been an important part of world history and culture for over two millennia. Masley's innovative technique adds thumbpicks to the traditional playing style, which enables plucking, striking, and bowing of this ancient instrument.\n\nMichael Masley's music has been heard in a diverse array of venues and contexts including original contributions to the soundtrack to Geronimo: An American Legend, on which he worked with guitar legend Ry Cooder. Masley has also recorded with producer and Garbage drummer Butch Vig and appears on the multi-platinum Garbage Version 2.0.\n\nIn addition to impressive collaborations, Masley's music has been heard in NFL broadcasts, The 1994 Winter Olympics, Entertainment Tonight, HBO programming, and most recently?in Martin Yernazian's upcoming documentary, Art Officially Favored by Pyrotecnia Productions. Masley's also been profiled by NPR's All Things Considered where excerpts from his CD, Mystery Repeats Itself, still occasionally surface in their programming. His song \"Six White Horses\" is featured on the All Songs Considered CD, published by NPR Classics.\n\nMichael is also active politically as \"The Artist General\", a self-created position (similar to the Surgeon General) he has created to represent the interests of artists in the USA.\n\nNote that Mystery Repeats Itself is a compilation of previous works, and includes some songs present on Cymbalom Solos. Masley also plays hammered dulcimer duets with Magnatune artist Jamie Janover on \"All Strings Considered\"." .

From his recordings of American Shaker melodies to an album of Rumi's poetry set to strings, Phillips' expansive body of work has been gleaned from traditions around the globe and encompasses more than eight centuries of music.\n\nPhillips' newest album Tr?d. is a contemporary celebration of Scandinavian folk songs and original compositions. In addition to Phillips on cello, Tr?d. features two of Sweden's premier players: master nyckelharpist Olov Johansson of the band V?sen and virtuoso fiddler, Olof G?thlin. The album's title combines the abbreviation for the English word \"traditional\" and the Swedish and Norwegian word \"tr?d,\" meaning \"thread.\" It's an album rich with the character of Scandinavian folklore, while its modern, streamlined arrangements make for a sound both elegant and earthy.\n\nPhillips holds a Masters of Music degree in composition from the San Francisco Conservatory and has collaborated with Ravi Shankar on several compositions, including two pieces for celebrated cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. In November of 2002, he accompanied Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton, and other rock luminaries in The Concert for George?a memorial to George Harrison at The Royal Albert Hall in London. He has performed and recorded with such world renowned artists as fiddler Alasdair Fraser, harpist Aine Minogue, and the legendary British rock group Camel.\n\nPhillips' previous recordings include Gourd's Shaker Trilogy (co-produced with William Coulter): Simple Gifts, Tree of Life, and Music on the Mountain. He also composed and produced The World Turned Upside Down, a reinterpretation of popular colonial American music that was featured in the PBS production of Ken Burns' Thomas Jefferson." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/holowach> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Filmmaker John Holowach's musical career unexpectedly began after first hearing Rob Dougan's Furious Angels. He immediately fell into remixing all the tracks for the pure pleasure of experimenting with music?an effort which eventually led to the writing and recording of his own original material. His first solo album, A Basement Of Broken Dreams was released digitally in January of 2005 and aired widely on podcasts and Internet radio. Holowach was also featured on Current TV and in several documentary and narrative films.\n\nJohn is now immersed in writing original music, but still participates widely in remix culture. He's an active samplist, which means he takes clips from other tracks, songs, and sounds (mostly Creative Commons-licensed), and creates something new with them.\n\nIn addition to his solo work, John is also a founding member of the international Creative Commons band, Tryad. His influences range from DJ Shadow and Nine Inch Nails to Beethoven and The Beatles." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/hans_christian> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Hans Christian's musical journey began many years ago in Germany by studying the cello. \"I started to play when I was nine years old and had a private teacher for 10 years. Although my teacher imposed a strict and disciplined approach to learning the instrument I remember him fondly; he was preparing me to go to the music conservatory to become a professional cellist. Deep in my heart, though, I knew all along that this was not going to happen.\" His life was to unfold along different lines.\n\nSince his father was a minister at a Lutheran church in Hanover, Hans played in that church many times and confesses some early musical adventures: \"I would steal the key to the church from my father's desk sometimes and sneak into the church to play there at night. It was dark and cold, but the acoustics were amazing. I am talking about a building in the Neo-Gothic style, big enough for almost a thousand people. So, I would sit in front of the altar, that sacred space, and I didn't know if I was violating God's space or was welcome. I loved those anxious moments and expressed my emotions in wild improvisations.\"\n\nThe unyielding urge to express himself led him to pick up the bass guitar as a teenager and get absorbed in rock music. \"I would play along with Hendrix records, and Santana, Pink Floyd and the Doors. I started to play in local bands in Hanover, dressing outrageously and wearing makeup. I lived out my wild fantasies one night while playing classical music the next day. I liked the discipline of the cello studies and the wildness of the rock bands.\"\n\nPerhaps this duality is a key ingredient to understanding Hans Christian's music and his approach to his own compostions and to his work with RASA, his well-known collaboration with singer Kim Waters. Often starting with a simple melody, Hans weaves an unconventional orchestral treatment that adds a very dense and multi-layered quality to his music, not shying away from any combination of instruments- but always guided by a strong sense of melody and musical development.\n\nHans acknowledges, \"Whether it is with RASA or on my solo projects, I try to keep it very listenable but very interesting, too. I want the listener to travel with the music and have their own experiences.\"\n\nWhen he was 21 years old he decided to move to Los Angeles to study bass at Musician's Institute in Hollywood. It was a big adventure, not knowing anybody in LA and without a place to stay. But within six weeks of his arrival he played at the Whiskey on Sunset Blvd, and within a year he was very connected to the local music scene. \"I played every hole-in-the-wall club you can imagine, constantly playing with many different kinds of groups, from dark and hard-etched bands to folk and performance artists. It was a fulfillment of my dreams because I could do whatever I wanted, and I tried many different things.\"\n\nEventually he worked with established artists like Robbie Robertson, Toni Childs, Victoria Williams, and the Sparks, appearing live and on television. But a persistent urge to express his own ideas kept him on the run. \"I felt a strong pull towards doing my own music, to go deeper, and so I stretched out on the cello, practicing constantly, composing difficult pieces and pushing myself very hard.\"\n\nThis creative drive led him to start his own production company, Allemande Music, expanding into all aspects of music production. Besides recording his own music and the music of RASA, Hans has produced and engineered a rich variety of recording projects with other artists. After almost ten years in the San Francisco area, Hans and his partner, Kim Waters, have recently relocated to Door County, Wisconsin, where they have built yet another recording studio. Hans says about this move that \"I wanted to fulfill this dream of living in a four season environment where it is beautiful, clean, and quiet, so that I can focus on my work more easily. California is a great place to network but it became too exhausting to live there.\"\n\nWhile RASA is the main focus of Hans' musical activities with four CDs in the last four years and an active touring schedule, he has just re-mastered his two most recent solo projects (Phantoms and Surrender) which are re-released through Magnatune.com and a few other companies. Additional solo recordings can be expected in the near future." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/sonnerie> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Sonnerie is one of the foremost and most respected period instrument ensembles in the world. Founded by Monica Huggett in 1982 and based in London, the group has been acclaimed for its performances from Sydney to Paris, and from Helsinki to Vancouver, as well as its numerous concerts at London's prestigious Wigmore Hall. Sonnerie's core group consists of four musicians: Monica Huggett, violin, Emilia Benjamin, violin, viola da gamba and viola, Joseph Crouch, cello and viola da gamba, and Matthew Halls on the keyboards. These four form the basis of the larger chamber ensemble while also functioning as a flexible smaller unit, performing trio sonatas, quartets and the like.\n\nThe group has recorded for Virgin Classics, ASV, Harmonia Mundi USA, Teldec, and CPO with a disc of Vivaldi's Trio Sonatas Op.1. They marked a step into later repertoire with a recording of the Mozart Piano Quartets for ASV. Their most recent releases include a disc of the Biber 1681 Violin Sonatas, together with Nisi Dominus, with Thomas Guthrie, that won a Gramophone Award in 2002; Handel Trio Sonatas, The World's First Piano Concertos with David Owen Norris, and Handel Organ Concertos featuring Matthew Halls.\n\nNotable past engagements include Boston Early Music Festival, Gulbenkian Early Music Days in Lisbon, Vantaa Baroque week in Finland, Kothen Bachfest in Germany, Early Music festivals in Glasgow, Aldeburgh, and Birmingham, a visit to St. Petersburg and tours of the US and Canada.\n\nRecent engagements include the Halle Handel Festival, the Ansbach Festival, the Nordic Baroque Festival in Sweden and the Spitalfields Festival in London. Sonnerie have also performed recently at the Tudeley Festival, the Snape Proms, the Theatre Royal Bath, in Oxford, and at the Wigmore Hall and St John's Smith Square.\n\nMatthew Halls received his early musical training as an organist, working first of all at Southwell Minster and then at Salisbury Cathedral before taking up the organ scholarship at New College, Oxford. He took a first class degree in music and was appointed Assistant Organist at New College and Director of Music at the University Church. Matthew was harpsichordist with the European Union Baroque Orchestra in 1998, touring extensively throughout Europe and the Middle East, and since then has worked as a keyboard player with many of Europe's leading period instrument ensembles. Since 1999 he has been a regular member of the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra, participating in Ton Koopman's ongoing project to record the complete cantatas of J. S. Bach. Recent solo engagements have included concerto appearances in Frankfurt, Nuremberg and at the International Handel Festival in Halle and recitals in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. He joined Sonnerie in 2000." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/rapoon> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "I first began to work seriously with sound in the mid-seventies. I moved into this medium from the disciplines of painting and printmaking. Sound had the added attraction of unfolding over time.\n\nTime is an important aspect in my work. There are references and connections to time running throughout the body of my work from the first to the last.\n\nEarly influences included Can and Neu, Stockhausen and Cage. These gradually gave way to the music that I was discovering myself which was more in line with Eno and Hassell and extreme experimentalists like Throbbing Gristle and Test Department.\n\nI was a founder member of the band :zoviet*france: who are generally regarded as amongst the pioneers of the post-industrial experimental genre and who have influenced many more mainstream bands in the following years.\n\nMy own work has been noted as having a unique style and individuality and has itself fed back into more mainstream genres in the form of commissioned sample libraries, collaborations and re-mixes, and film and installation work.\n\nAs a continuing practitioner in the visual arts I do not draw a clear distinction between the two mediums. The work in both areas is inter-related and cross-referenced. This is perhaps best illustrated by referring to my earliest releases, which were vinyl LP's encased in a succession of unlikely and impractical \"sleeves\". This served at least two purposes; one being to demonstrate that the \"object\" was equally as important as the music contained in the medium. (These sleeves were all hand-made and hand-printed on a variety of materials including hessian, hardboard, aluminum, roofing-felt, ceramic boxes etc. and have since become collector's items as \"art objects\".)\n\nThe second purpose derived exactly from the \"punk\" ethos of doing it yourself and the \"fuck you\" attitude embodied within punk. (We had been told that it was impossible to make these sleeves in any commercially viable quantity and were determined to prove the critic's wrong.)\n\nThe third purpose, of course, was that it set our releases apart from the norm.\n\nWhenever possible I have carried this practice over into later works and continued to place equal emphasis on the artwork included with a release and the object itself, with CDs encased in specially designed, and often hand-made, packaging. The purpose, once again, is to make something \"special\" and to elevate it beyond the usual defining parameters. Subsequently they have become objects of much greater significance to people than they would have been had they been released in ordinary cardboard sleeves or crystal cases.\n\nThe definition of the genre that I work within is one that is also open to interpretation. I think of my work as \"soundtrack\" music and as such it remains open to the inclusion of whatever style I see as relevant. This also allows me to include narrative occasionally e.g. \"Tin of Drum\" includes narrative pieces written and performed by myself. These owe something to David Lynch and Twin Peaks.\n\nA visit to the real Twin Peaks during an American tour prompted me to later write the pieces which were imaginary spoken statements given to the FBI concerning the whereabouts of the narrators on a date some forty-five years previously. The point being that this would be an almost impossible task, yet all the people \"interviewed\" managed to give accounts of the day in question. It didn't really matter if the stories were true or not, the narrators were all glad to have been asked as it somehow gave some kind of meaning to their lives.\n\nThis is reflected in the statements that they make which include details and insights into their lives, as they judge them to be. In this case these characters (like Becket's) judge their lives as essentially pointless and filled with regret.\n\nThe \"Tin of Drum\" in the title is a reference to my own search for some comfort whilst in a situation that at times seemed pointless and wearisome. In the middle of an exhausting and demanding tour where I missed my family and home my \"happiness\" devolved down to feeding my (then) last remaining addiction - tobacco. After running out of the rolling tobacco that I had brought with me from Europe I had been reduced to buying awful, unsmokeable American blends and was growing more and more agitated and depressed. Then at an unpromising gas stop I wandered into the small store and there alone on the shelf behind the counter was a solitary tin of Drum rolling tobacco. (My all-time favourite.) It suddenly became the Holy Grail of salvation; I could almost see a blazing aura of light around it. My body jumped for joy and once again I was confronted with the question \"what do we seek from life\" and what makes us \"happy\".\n\nWe can search for truth and meaning and enlightenment yet seemingly \"bliss\" can be attained with a hand-rolled cigarette of Dutch tobacco and a cup of Italian espresso.\n\nReflections on the human need to attach some kind of \"meaning\" to life could serve as one definition of what my work is about." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/american_baroque> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Founded in San Francisco in 1986, American Baroque brings together some of America's most accomplished and exciting baroque instrumentalists, with the purpose of defining a new, modern genre for historical instruments. The group's adventurous programs combine 18th-century music with new works, composed for the group through collaborations and commissions from American composers. An ensemble of eclectic, accomplished, and artful musicians, the performances bridge a gap between the edges of the new music frontier and the familiar roads to music of the past, and expands the repertoire and scope of historical instruments into the new millenium.\n\nIn its early stages, American Baroque functioned as a studio band, its mission being to record hitherto unknown quartets by Telemann. Recordings of the \"Paris\" quartets and the Fourth Book of Quartets were released and enthusiastically received. In 1991, the group recorded French Cantatas of the 18th Century with soprano Julianne Baird, again released to wide critical acclaim on Koch International Classics. In 1992, American Baroque began exploring the territory of performing new music written for historical instruments through its collaboration with composer, member and gambist Roy Whelden and his pieces Quartet After Abel and Gamba Quartet, which resulted in a CD release on the New Albion label in 1993.\n\nIntrigued by the unique timbres and subtlety of sounds inherent in their period instruments as well as the excitement and anticipation of performing new music, the group continued to pursue projects and programming that involved combinations of new and old elements. Another collaboration in 1995 with Whelden yielded the provocative CD Like a Passing River with poet and reader Rudy Rucker, also on the New Albion label.\n\nSince its founding, the ensemble has been featured at the Tage Alter Musik Festival in Regensburg, Germany; the Berkeley Early Music Festival; the San Luis Obispo Mozart Festival; the San Jose Chamber Music Society; University of California; the San Francisco Early Music Society; on National Public Radio and West Coast Live; and in the Opus415 New Music Festival. In addition, ensemble members perform and record together in the finest period-instrument orchestras in America throughout the year. Recent projects include concerts at the University of Vermont and at Bowdoin College, and a multi-tracked studio recording of Songs of Cold Mountain, a cycle of texts by the 7th-century poet Han Shan. The 1998-1999 season included a commercial recording of eight pieces by the composer's collective, Common Sense, which were commissioned in 1996; and a theatrical and multimedia collaboration entitled \"The Death of Anton Webern,\" written and directed by ensemble member Katherine Shao; the group will present a 2-week run of performances in May 2000.\n\nAmerican Baroque has also received support from Chamber Music America's Millenium Commissioning Program to collaborate with Stanford University composer Jonathan Berger on his new work, Of Hammered Gold (for flute, oboe, violin, viola da gamba and digital bird organ); the work was premiered at Stanford University's Lively Arts series on January 7, 2000. The ensemble has been recognized through grants and awards from the Aaron Copland Foundation, the Mikhashoff Foundation for New Music, and the Zellerbach Family Fund, and most recently won first prize for the 2000 ASCAP Awards for Adventurous Programming. American Baroque remains the only U.S. chamber ensemble committed to performing both new music and 18th-century works on historical instruments, while continuing to explore the issues raised by both genres, old and new." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/ion> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Ion is a new solo venture by established UK musician, David J. Hughes. Most people will know David as the founder member of T-Bass and the last man standing in the SkinMechanix collaboration. Both of these ventures typify the Hughes approach to making music. In other words, foot-on-the-floor, pedal-to-the-metal, full-on electronic power tracks with only an occasional nod towards slower, more romantic moods and feelings.\n\nIon, however, represents a musical tanent for Hughes?a back-to-basics approach with an emphasis on a more symphonic, relaxed sound.\n\nSays David, \"The Ion project came about more or less by accident. In the midst of testing our recently developed ZEIT Step Sequencer, someone forgot to hit the stop button on the recorder and found that we had accidentally recorded more than 20 minutes of random, sequenced noodling, which had no real structure and no real direction. However, rather than just delete the session, we decided to listen ... and came away with the feeling that the music had a raw and unprocessed feel, it was completely natural, unforced and unhurried, the sound of a musician happy to do nothing more than aimlessly wander down strange and previously unexplored pathways.\"\n\nThe end result was the track The Silent Scream, which was editted down from 20 minutes of ambient indulgence to just 5 minutes of actual music. The chords and the lead lines came a few minutes later, composed on the fly and in one pass, with successful takes simply cut and pasted together to build up the layers.\n\n\"We were stunned by the realisation that it was possible to write something that was just about halfway decent in such a short space of time, the music of Ion grew out of this new-found fascination for tightly controlled rhythmic patterns coupled with the joy of re-discoevering the lost art of improvised electronic music.\"\n\nListen to the music of Ion and simply enjoy. Sequencer music doesn't get any better than this." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/indidginus> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Michael Martin has been playing didgeridoo since 1996. His first real foray into dance music came in 1998 after returning from a period of work and travel in Tanzania. Martin attended the Megadog Beach Festival in Cornwall and was so inspired by what he heard and experienced that he decided to incorporate his didgeridoo playing into this style of music.\n\nAt first this effort began with Martin playing along with various techno and trance DJ's as the popular \"Deviant Didg\" at squat parties and clubs in London like The Fridge, Club 414, The Pleasure Rooms, Tyssen Street, and the Drome. Whilst this was good practice, he soon grew rather restless and decided to involve himself in Koru, a drum and bass live PA based in Brixton. (\"PA\" means live electronic performing musicians).\n\nMichael began playing with these techno and trance DJs around London and at festivals like the Lizard Eclipse in Cornwall. This introduced him to the production side of things and he was hooked. He didn't like being a passive member of the band who \"just played didg\". He wanted to actively create tracks from start to end. Studio equipment, however, does not come cheap, so he took out a career development loan, trained as a software developer, earned some extra money, and bought the necessary gear. Shortly after he joined up with another drum and bass live PA (Impact) and gigged with them. This was fun for a while, but he found himself drifting into becoming \"the didg player\" again, so he decided that another change was in order.\n\nFollowing a 2001 Bristol Halloween party at which his psytrance live PA OOOD was playing, Michael got to know Colin Bennun. The two became friends & started writing psytrance tracks together from time to time. He has had the good fortune to work with talented guitarist, Joe Weinstock, who is featured on several Indidginus tracks. Michael is currently involved in a collaboration with Ishq (Matt Hillier) performing under the name Open System.\n\nMichael has played at a wide variety of events in his home country (UK), adopted country (South Africa), and elsewhere in the world. In February 2004 he moved to South Africa, where he has written soundtracks for several TV commercials, a couple of series, and a documentary. He is currently writing the soundtrack to the independent feature film Cognition Factor featuring collaborations with Alex Paterson (The Orb), Colin Angus (The Shamen, Pablo Sandoz) & Merv Pepler (Eat Static)." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/william_brooks> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "William Brooks' story reads like a pack of lies but swears it's all true. William was born and raised just north of The Red River and a tad south of The Arbuckle Mountains in southern Oklahoma. After a dismal, failed attempt at working in the oil business, Brooks packed up camp and moved to New York City. After crashing on the floor of noted author Brett Leveridge(Men My Mother Dated) he finally settled down in what he considers the smallest apartment in NYC's last great red-light district, Hell's Kitchen. William has acted in about a dozen movies and TV shows.\n\nHe has been detained by police on several occasions but never actually arrested, got caught in a revolving door with Bob Dylan, jumped out of more than 7 perfectly good airplanes, waitered in a Chinese restaurant earning the nickname \"Sing Ging Ping\" which translates to \"Neurons Don't Meet\", saw the Beatles in concert, has seen at least 4 ghosts, none of which he knew and is most proud of writing 2 songs with critically acclaimed Rick Moody, author of The Ice Storm.\n\nNative Oklahoman William Brooks has played many of Gotham's most notable digs from The Stephen Talkhouse, The Public Theater, The Continental Divide, Arlene Grocery, Wetlands, Webster Hall and CBGB`s to Tramps and Fez.\n\nI grew up in a small Oklahoma town and have retained most of what that means...courtesy, manners, and a great love of malls.....\n\nI was raised in a house full of women so I learned early to leave the lid down and knock before I walk into a room...\n\nI've lived in NYC for many years and I still smile at strangers, which usually gets me a lotta strange looks back.\n\nMy first 5 years in NYC was one VERY lost weekend, I stepped inside my first Irish pub and didn't leave for 5 years...After my head cleared a bit I eventually figured what I wanted to do, I wanted to be the fifth Beatle but it was too late..so I started writing my own songs as a hobby and of course to impress girls..I did take me a while to realize that while I was busy singing to people at parties, the other guys were snagging the girls..Now I don't sing at parties anymore....\n\nI do perform in clubs with my rock band. do some solo gigs and I love trying out new songs down in the NYC Subway System...You will always get an honest reaction down there...If they love ya you'll know it ... I even have a music video on the web if you'd like to see me make a complete fool out of myself. Just kidding....it's pretty cool....it's at Zebox.com. While I was perorming down in Kerrville Texas at The Folk FestivalI realized I am not a folk artist, I am a folk rocker. There is a huge difference\n\nI love movies, prank phone calls, sushi, buffalos, horses, political news, bad jokes, Tex-Mex, The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Ricki Lee Jones, to laugh, the A minor chord, long silences and old Ford Mustangs..Well that's my story and I'm sticking to it!!!!\n" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/armchair> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "I learned to play arrangements of country and delta blues, ragtime and other early 20th century music on guitar as a beginner. These were contractions of the originals. Notes deeper and higher than what a guitar could sound were squeezed into a narrower range and some complexities had to be removed altogether. The arrangements on Too Much Mustard are quite different. If anything they are expansions in many senses of the word. The harmonic overtones shimmer, dance and bass-lines crab and growl in ways impossible with non-digital instruments. These may be late 19th/early 20th century popular tunes, but they use distinctly 21st century instruments. These arrangements were literally painted using special software, not performed. In many ways they are 21st century equivalents of early 20th century player pianos. In many ways Professor Armchair straddles the centuries.\n\nThis music at its best evokes happiness of a by-gone era. Circuses and carousels and calliopes, oh my! To some they may appear to be pandering, even kitsch. But the truth is they reflect the optimism, the innocence and the fun-loving of our great grandparents. They saw the future as a time for opportunity, for hope, for joy. And what could be bad in that? Few could imagine the horrors of two world wars nor fewer still the attacks of the 21st century.\n\nMany of the titles are obscure, yet some achingly familiar. Where have we heard Me-ow before? In grainy old black and white cartoons of mewling alley cats, most likely, but I've been unable to find such a cartoon in my modest collection (and I have copies of all the Betty Boop cartoons).\n\nIs this music whose time has come and gone? Ragtime's popularity has never completely disappeared. And nearly everyone will associate Funeral March of a Marionette with a certain film director with a highly characteristic, bulbous profile.\n\nOther figures of public notoriety associated themselves with these songs. The title tune \"Tres Moutarde\" (Too Much Mustard) was the theme song of early pilot Lincoln Beachey. Beachey hired bands to play it as he looped the loop in his small stunt airplane before paying crowds of amazed onlookers. He felt the song's title Too Much Mustard suited his personality to a \"T.\" He was just a little too much. The arrangements in this collection are perhaps just a bit too much mustard themselves.\n\nIs this music suitable only for children? As they say in the circus: this is music for \"children of all ages.\"\n\nIf you look behind the curtain, you'll find that Professor Armchair is none other than Magnatue artist Glen Bledsoe." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/jade_leary> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Jade Leary is a fiercely independent artist from Montreal. A musician from a very young age, he evolved from the Montreal underground scene of the late 80s. He has played with renowned avant-rock musicians Bernard Falaise and Remi Leclerc (Miriodor, Klaxon Gueule, Papa Boa) in various projects. His 90's rock band SoulCirkus caught the eye (and ear!) of The Cult bassist Jamie Stewart, and spent 4 weeks on CHOM-FM's top ten list.\n\nIn 2002, well before the current wave of digital downloads, he initiated a project called FairPlay - a distribution model for the new millennium that urged musicians to take matters in their own hands and distribute their music as digital files under a shareware type license. Although the project has since folded he continues to believe in its underlying principles, which are now present in projects like Magnatune and Gabriel/Eno's MUDDA, says Jade, \"when various individuals, from different parts of the world, from diverse backgrounds get the same idea pretty much at the same time, it means this idea's time has come. This is a revolution. We're not going back.\"\n\nA multi-instrumentist, he now works alone, weaving projects that have taken more and more of an intimate and introspective turn. His third album The Lost Art of Human Kindness, his first on the Magnatune label, is a perfect reflection of that tangent. It was featured on Apple's Quicktime web site and media player for several weeks and described in QuickTime News as \"...a surrealistic blend of voice, electronics, and unusual orchestrations that defy categorization.\"." .

The next year Scotland's Twenty Stone/Blatt Records released RCR's fit to rave reviews in the U.K. press. Meanwhile, RCR made several compilation appearances in the USA while recording their second album, Middle Age Suicide.

With King on lead vocals, bass and guitar, Dave Seiden on lead guitar and Alan Slimak on drums, Rocket City Riot maintains an active live show calendar, proving that fans still crave rock with real character and roots.\n" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/joglaresa> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Joglaresa is a well-established medieval music ensemble and are leaders in the improvisational and cross-cultural aspects of their repertoire. They won an Arts Council of England Early Music Award for their Hebrew/Arabic/Spanish programme Al 'Andalus, and received great critical acclaim for their Crusades programme The Scimitar and the Sword, which represents the voices of Judaism and Islam alongside the Christian viewpoint. Their first album of Judeo-Spanish songs Ballads of Love and Betrayal was released in 2002 (Village Life 010130 VL). Performances include the opening concert at the Aldeburgh Festival and the closing concert at York Early Music Festival; the Queen Elizabeth Hall (London), Brezice Early Music Festival (Slovenia), Istanbul, Amsterdam International Festival of Jewish Music; tours in Germany, Italy and Holland. Broadcasts include BBC Radio 3, 4, and World Service; German, Dutch and Slovenian radio.\n\nJoglaresa's musical style allows improvisational and ornamental freedom to all members of the ensemble, as you will hear on many of these tracks. Each of the Latin hymns is found in various European sources and Joglaresa has decided to pronounce them in an Italian style because most of the vernacular songs are in Italian. Some pieces do not have extant melodies so the medieval technique of contrafactum has been applied and other well- known melodies of the time used.\n\nDirector Belinda Sykes is an international concert and recording soloist. She studied voice and improvisation in Morocco, Bulgaria, Syria, Spain and India; oboe and recorder at the Guildhall School of Music. She has performed/recorded with Red Byrd, New London Consort, Tragicomedia, Harp Consort, Paul O'Dette, Ensemble Unicorn, Sarband, Dufay Collective and Oni Wytars and is Professor of Medieval Song at Trinity College of Music. As an oboist she has played for the Gabrieli Consort, English Concert, King's Consort, BBC Symphony Orchestra, Age of Enlightenment and Hanover Band, and has collaborated with many composers including Sir Harrison Birtwistle." .

Under the leadership of Nicholas McGegan, Music Director since 1985, Philharmonia has become \"an ensemble for early music as fine as any in the world today,\" according to Los Angeles Times critic Alan Rich. The Orchestra performs a subscription season in four cities in the San Francisco Bay Area, and is regularly heard on tour in United States and internationally. In addition to Mr. McGegan, the Orchestra has welcomed eminent guest conductors to its podium including William Christie, Andrew Parrott, Jordi Savall, Gustav Leonhart, Monica Huggett and Stanley Ritchie.\n\nUnder the direction of Mr. McGegan, Philharmonia has made several United States tours, each of which included an appearance on the Great Performers Series at Lincoln Center. Other appearances include debuts at Carnegie Hall (NY) and Walt Disney Concert Hall (Los Angeles) in February 2005. In August of 2005 the Orchestra made its debut at the BBC Proms, Snape Maltings (UK) and The Concertgebouw in Amsterdam.\n\nIn August 2002, the Orchestra made its Mostly Mozart Festival debut with five performances including a concert featuring Handel's newly-discovered Gloria in excelsis Deo and four performances of Handel's L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato with Mark Morris Dance Group. A return engagement in August 2003 featured the Orchestra in the Festival's first fully-staged opera, Mozart's Il re pastore. In March of 1998 Philharmonia performed Handel's Saul and Hercules at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and in 1999 the Orchestra made its European debut at the International Handel Festival in Gottingen, Germany, with return appearances in 2001 and 2002.\n\nIn 1990, Philharmonia began an extremely successful collaboration with the Mark Morris Dance Group. In May of that year, the Orchestra appeared at the Brooklyn Academy of Music with the Dance Group in Morris' production of Purcell's Dido and Aeneas. Subsequent performances have included a program of mixed works featuring Vivaldi's Gloria; Handel's L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato, presented again in March of 2000 and September of 2003 by UC Berkeley's Cal Performances; and the American premiere of Morris' production of Rameau's ballet-opera Platee, which was the tour de force of the 1998 Berkeley Festival. Platee was again performed in September 2001 in Los Angeles and Berkeley." .

His first three cd's, \"Heartstrings\", \"Feverdreams\" and \"Headlands\" mark this period between 1996 and 2000 which feature Daniel creating other worldly soundscapes and a playing technique drawing on his myriad influences, including that of the great kora masters of our time.\n\nWhile on the road as guitarist and kora player with Djali Kunda Kuyate (the twins) in December of 2002 through Senegal, Gambia and Mali, Daniel not only studied kora and ngoni with various masters there but captured his experiences on minidisc.\n\nThe result is his latest work, \"Calabashmoon\", a collection of crafty and poignant kora pieces woven with a tapestry of sounds and impressions of West Africa.\n\nDaniel also plays guitar, handsonic, kora and gravikord for Artemis and is a featured electronic artist on rtfm records under the moniker \"vessel\".\n\nDaniel has also composed many ecclectic scores for choreographers and dance companies in San Francisco, notably Sarah Shelton Mann, ODC, Company Chaddick, Lizz Roman and Dancers, Kunst-Stoff and many others.\n\nDaniel Berkman also plays in the band of Magnatune artist Artemis.\n" .

Each of them spent several years with different bands, becoming familiar with the club circuit, and gaining a perspective that was more about nightlife and the social scene than academics.\n\nThey formed Mutandina in early 2000 with the intent of creating a sound that was distinct and personal, without rigid style or preconceptions, and drew on the vivid mixture of styles that was part of their individual experience: jazz, salsa, funk, rock, pop, Brazilian and Latin American music. The result is a decidedly hip blend of salsa and funk, infused with distinctly Argentine elements.\n\nThe members of Mutandina are:\nAriel \"Cordero\" Polenta - piano, Wurlitzer, Hammond, keys, voices, arrangements\nChristian \"Turco\" Fahiad - drums, percussion\nNicolas Luis Humberto \"Rigo\" Quesada - guitars, voices\nMarcos \"Mariomarqueti\" Archetti - bass, voices\nMatias \"Mato\" Ruiz - acoustic and electric guitars, tenor sax, composition, arrangements and lead vocals.

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/thornside> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "First, a true story.\nWhen Thornside was in his mid twenties, he worked at McDonalds. Believe it or not, he came so far as to being a \"white shirt\", bossing around. But of course Thornside had a boss over him, a crazy but nice man from Iran. When he heard that Thornside sang and played the trumpet, he immediately insisted (or \"decided\" is probably the right word) that Thornside should play for the guests between four and five every Tuesday. Thornside called his old friend Burnshee, with whom he was playing in different bands, and asked him to play with him. They formed a duo, performing jazz standards and some dixie, in the corner of the McDonalds restaurant at Kungsgatan in Stockholm, Sweden. Thornside singing, playing trumpet and banjo, and Thornside playing the guitar. Two hundred Swedish kronor and a free meal was the deal. And the start of what 15 years later would be Burnshee Thornside, the funky jazzy whacky duo from Sweden. (What the guests thought at the moment is not very clear. One thing is for sure: they did not come only to hear Thornside and Burnshee.)\n\nIt started in the early 80's\nJohan Nilsson and Jens Henriksson - Burnshee Thornside - met in their teens and formed many bands playing mostly funk. It was the days of the \"slapping bass\" so you had to get hold of a good bassplayer, who knew how to use his thumb. Compared to the rock bands, you also had to have horns, and you had to know how to arrange for horns. Trumpets, saxophones, trombones. Thornside, being also a trumpet player, knew that, so we had great horn arrangements from day one. We made a lot of our own music, played many gigs, and we listened to Earth Wind & Fire, Kool & The Gang, Steely Dan, Koinonia, Gino Vanelli, Chaka Khan, Rufus, James Brown, jazz and blues, Zappa, Weather Report... Sometimes Burnshee and Thornside would meet up in the rehearsal studio to record together, on their own. A little pleasure they had, together with the 4-track Fostex Cassette Recorder. It sounded very Motown...\n\nThe year 2003\nAfter pursuing different careers (IT, Advertising, computers), of course neither Thornside or Burnshee made a living out of music, altough it gave some good extra money, Burnshee finally made one of his dreams come true: his own studio in the basement. Based around a Mac G4 and Logic. All of a sudden Burnshee and Thornside were back were it all started. Recording, making music, composing, arranging. They looked at each other and decided to start all over. But first they had to get rid of their Swedish sounding names - Johan Nilsson and Jens Henriksson - so they named themselves Burnshee Thornside and their first recording in the new studio was of their old song \"Hey Hey Hey\" (which now appears on the Burnshee Thornside Album Blues and misc.) After that they composed 14 brand new songs and invited the magic musician Tomas Bergquist in to play drums and bass (he is still with us). The releasing of \"The Art Of Not Blending In\" was quite successful, there being no record label behind it. We got some airtime on a small radiostation in Oregon, and Australia, and we sold some albums via magnatune.com who supported us from the start. Everybody said it sounded like Steely Dan and Michael McDonald, mostly thanks to Thornside's voice, we guess, but also due to the fact that the music is kind of Rhythm & Blues. With a jazzy feeling. And then a bit funky. And with horns. The lyrics, that's quite another story. They are not only about love. They can be about anything...\n\nThe years 2004 and 2005\nIn 2004 Burnshee Thornside released \"Blues & misc.\", as the title reveals, a whole lot of blues, but also funky jazzy stuff, 12 tracks. A bit more simple. Not as many horn arrangements. Not as many background vocals performed by great sounding female singers. But still very good. (Some regard \"Blues and misc.\" as better than \"The Art Of Not Blending In\".)\n\nAnd then, in 2005, came \"Rock This Moon\". 15 new tracks, back to more horns, more background vocals, more 70's jazzy/funky Steely Dan-ish. With fun, intriguing and whacky lyrics.\n\nIs this only the beginning? Yes, we think so! And maybe, just maybe, one day people will come to McDonalds only because Burnshee Thornside is playing in the sound system." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/serenissima> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "La Serenissima was founded in 1994 for a performance of Antonio Vivaldi's La Senna Festeggiante (RV 693). Since then, it has given the U.K. premieres of many Vivaldi works including Ottone in Villa (RV 729), Giustino (RV 724) Tito Manlio (RV 717), Tremori al braccio (RV 799), the Concerto per la Solennita della S.

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/latham-koenig> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Jan Latham-Koenig, born in England in 1953 of French, Danish and Polish descent, studied at the Royal College of Music. After winning all the major conducting and piano prizes and a Gulbenkian Fellowship, he first made his mark as a concert pianist, but in 1981 decided to concentrate exclusively on conducting. He has conducted most of the major orchestras in Britain including the Royal Philharmonic, Philharmonia, London Philharmonic, Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, Royal Scottish National, Halle and all the BBC orchestras. With his own group, the Koenig Ensemble, which he founded in 1976, he has conducted many ambitious and highly-successful projects. From 1989 to 1992 he was Music Director of the Orquestra do Porto, which he formed at the instigation of the Portuguese government.\n\nMusic Director of both the Orchestre Philharmonique de Strasbourg and Opera du Rhin since the 1997-98 season, his work there has been very favourably received. Recent productions have included Turandot and Elektra, and the ballet Prince of the Pagodas. His production of Dialogues des Carmelites won the Claude-Rostand prize for Best Regional Opera production (1999) and also the Diapason d'or for the best opera video (2001). His other Strasbourg productions have included Macbeth, La Bohme, Peter Grimes, Tristan, Pelleas et Melisande, Korngold's Die Tote Stadt and Carmen. In May 1999, he brought the orchestra to the Barbican, London, for a Gala concert in celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Council of Europe, returning in 2002 for a highly-acclaimed performance of Berlioz's The Damnation of Faust. Also in London, Latham-Koenig has conducted the Opera du Rhin in his much-praised Dialogues des Carmelites at the BBC Proms. Other opera performances abroad have included Henze's Venus & Adonis (Genoa), Tosca (Bastille), Dialogues, Jenufa and Hamlet (Royal Danish Opera) and I Lombardi (Santiago, Chile). He regularly performs with this orchestra at Chatelet, Baden-Baden and in other venues in France. Other recent tours include Wroclaw, to perform Szymanowski's King Roger, and Greece.\n\nJan Latham-Koenig's guest conducting takes him to many countries. He has appeared with orchestras worldwide: in America, with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and St Paul Chamber Orchestra; in Japan, with the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony and Tokyo Symphony; in France with the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France and Orchestra National Bordeaux Aquitaine; in Europe with orchestras including the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic, Rotterdam Philharmonic, the Danish and Swedish Radio orchestras, Stockholm Philharmonic, Dresden Philharmonic, Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin and the orchestras of Westdeutscher Rundfunk, Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk and Sudwestfunk in Germany. He enjoys performing in Italy, and has performed with the orchestras of the Teatro Comunale in Florence and RAI Turin. In 2001, he gave several concerts with the Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome and last season made a most successful concert debut with Deutsche Oper Berlin.\n\nOpera is a particular interest. From 1988 to 1990 he held the position of Principal Guest Conductor at the opera house in Rome. In 1988 he made an impressive debut at the Vienna State Opera (Macbeth) and was immediately re-invited for performances of Aida in May 1989. As Permanent Guest Conductor he conducted well over 100 performances there, including major revivals of Maria Stuarda and Macbeth, and, in 2001, Un Ballo in Maschera, La Traviata and I Puritani. His many European performances have taken him to the Royal Opera House (Covent Garden) and English National Opera; to the Bayerische Staatsoper, Deutsche Oper, Berlin, and Hamburg State Opera; to Verona Opera and La Fenice (Venice), and to Royal Danish Opera, Royal Swedish Opera and the opera houses in Genoa, Lisbon, Toulouse, Monte-Carlo, Bonn, Stuttgart and Bilbao. He has also visited the opera house in Santiago (Chile) and Canadian Opera. Opera festivals include Bregenz, Caracalla (Rome), Wexford, Macerata, Maggio Musicale in Florence, Torre del Lago, Vicenza, Bergamo, Lucca, Montepulciano and Montpellier. Opera broadcasts include Puccini's Edgar and Szymanowski's King Roger for Danish Radio; a cycle of Weill operas and radio cantatas for WDR and, in early 1999, Dialogues des Carmelites, broadcast nationwide by French television from the Opera du Rhin.\n\nIn 2001, Latham-Koenig and embarked on a notable new series of recordings, with Orchestre Philharmonique de Strasbourg, for Avie. Most recently he garnering international acclaim, including a Gramophone Editor's Choice and a Choc du Monde from Le Monde de la Musique, for the first CD release of Ibert's early two-act opera Persee et Andromde. Their first release for Avie was Franck's Symphony in D coupled with extracts from Psyche. For Capriccio he has recorded a Weill cycle including Mahagonny with Anja Silja, Der Zar lsst sich photographieren, Der Lindberghflug, Magna Carta, Der Silbersee, Happy End, Der Kuhhandel and Street Scene. His discography also includes Donizetti's Poliuto with Martinucci, Connell and Bruson (Nuova Era), Catalani's Dejanice, Henze's La cubana, Leoncavallo's La Boheme (Nuova Era) and Donizetti's Elisabetta al castello di Kenilworth (Ricordi). His three William Walton releases form part of the Chandos Walton cycle including the Violin Concerto (Lydia Mordkovitch), Viola Concerto (Nobuko Imai) and Facade Suites Nos. 1-3 with the London Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\nRecent seasons also included a very successful and ambitious concert presentation of La Boheme in the Amsterdam Concertgebouw with Netherlands Radio Philharmonic, consisting of Act I of Puccini's opera and Acts III and IV of Leoncavallo's; appearances with Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre National de Belgique and guest conducting in Europe and the Far East. Recent repertoire has included Mahler's massive Eighth Symphony, Britten's War Requiem and Janacek's Glagolithic Mass. Future plans include further engagements in Japan, return visits to a range of European orchestras and, in addition to his regular Strasbourg appearances, residencies, tours and recordings with Orchestre Philharmonique de Strasbourg." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/jag> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "I started playing rock guitar in 1978. OK, I banged on it a few times in 1976 but that doesn't count. I started playing in a cover band in Little Rock while still in high school. You know the story; Zep, Who, Stones, Skynyrd, etc.\n\nI did that for a few years then started to teach guitar while in college. I opened up my own recording studio in 1984 (still in business) and recorded about 40 90 minute cassettes of my own music over the next 20+ years. This was more experimental/rock/imporovisation music in the vein of old Pink Floyd or Captain Beeheart.\n\nI got into blues after discovering Robert Johnson and RL Burnside in 1998. I had heard lots of blues over the years but the only artist I really liked was Stevie Ray Vaughan. My music sounds nothing like him however. I had put down my guitar for a few years after getting hooked on computers. I only played sporadically but I noticed that I was abscent mindedly playing old blues riffs.\n\nI remembered that I had the Robert Johnson box set from the 30's and I started listening to it, not really intending to learn that style. A co-worker at the time was listening to internet radio and one fo the stations played lots of old blues artists like Son House, Mississippi Fred McDowell and of coure Robert Johnson. I was immediately hooked on the raw, funky style and investigated further.\n\nLearning these songs by ear was difficult as many are tuned differently from traditional guitar tunings and many artists of that era used capos to change keys which made it almost impossible to figure out what the tunings were. Eventually I stumbled across a video of Bukka White playing what looked like open E tuning. I tried it and voila! I was playing Robert Johnson licks in no time.\n\nI recorded my first 4 cd's in a little less than 12 months, 3 more followed in quick succsession.\n\nAfter years of playing complicated and almost orchestrated music that took days or weeks to record one song, it was refreshing to be able to knock out several songs in a day with just a guitar and a microphone. The fingerstyle picking allows the guitarist to use the thumb for the bass notes the the first and second fingers for the melody and chords. A full band can be imitated with just one guitar in this manner. This is one of the defining techniques of country blues (also know as delta blues). I've also taken up the blues harp which is featured in many of my songs as a solo or melodic intrument.\n\nI'm also recording what I call 'full band' blues at home on my trusty 7500 Macintosh which includes electric guitar, bass, drums, and even some electronica influences. Many of these songs reference the minimal sounds of the Chess Records recordings of Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf and Little Walter. So far I have recorded two CD's of 'electric blues'. I hope you enjoy my music - many people believe the blues is a dyiing art from ut nothing coudl be further from the truth, if anything it's growing and web sites like Magnatune can do nothing but help further 'the cause'." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/sun_palace> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Sun Palace is the musical vision of vocalist, songwriter, and musician Andriette Redmann, who was raised on a Wisconsin cherry farm that doubled as an artist colony?a place she describes as \"a combination of Ringling Brothers and a Bergman film.\" Andriette came from a musical family going back many generations and her earliest inspiration was her aunt, Frances Martinsek, a popular accordianist of the 1930's and 40's.\n\n\"Aunt Fran had me singing in front of audiences at the age of four in her cast-off silk and satin gowns,\" says Reddman. \"I loved her stories about playing for the Milwaukee Braves, the Green Bay Packers, and the German Chancellor.\"\n\nAs adulthood approached, Andriette launched herself into world travel and musical exploration, learning about jazz at Berklee College of Music, classical at Hunter College, and punk, electro-pop, and Bulgarian folk singing in New York City.\n\nSoon after her arrival in New York, Andriette landed a recording contract with CBS Italia Records. \"Performing in Itay was an absolutely 'Felliniesque' experience,\" she says. My band and I were appearing on Italian TV, playing in the popular 'FestivalBar,' and hanging out with the Italian rock stars. The wine, the food, the song?every moment was chaotic and surreal!\"\n\nThen tragedy struck, her parents passing away within two years of each other, and Andriette considers her time spent caring for them precious. \"Nothing can prepare you for the extreme feelings of losing both your parents,\" she says, \"especially when it happens when you're so young. I felt I was looking down over the sharp edge of the world and gazing into a black, bottomless abyss.\" Grief-stricken, Andriette continued to search for meaning through music and various esoteric studies in psychology and bodywork, finding inspiration through the pursuit of sacred Hawaiian Hula dancing.\n\nThe spirit genrated by Andriette's quest also led to the creation of Sun Palace, and its debut CD, Into Heaven, which featured ten songs dealing with death, life and the reflection of beauty that comes from both. With co-producer and guitarist John Rokosny (Smithereens/Carry Nation) onboard, along with lead guitarist Tony Geballe (DGM artist/Trey Gunn Band/Toyah/theatrical composer), Sun Palace began to enjoy national attention. The song \"Into Heaven\" was featured in the soundtrack of the film, Indian Fish, and the song \"Your Hands Lie Open\" appeared in national ad campaign. Songs from Into Heaven went into heavy rotation on XM Satellite Radio, and all Borders bookstores showcased the disc as well.\n\nIn 2005, Sun Palace announced the release of its critically acclaimed new album, Give Me a Perfect World: a delicately buoyant work of lush, layered folk-rock that Andriette lovingly dedicated it to her late brother and gifted musician, John Redmann, who appears on the recording, along with sister Marise Redmann. The record also features an illustrious lineup of major league recording industry veterans, including legendary drummer and percussionist Jerry Marotta (Peter Gabriel/Paul McCartney/Elvis Costello), Smithereens frontman Pat DiNizio, cellist Jane Scarpantoni (Springsteen/Lou Reed/REM), and drummer Mark Brotter (HEM).\n\nSays Andrietti: \"Give Me A Perfect World is ready for the world.\"" .

The objective was to get back to basics, to reclaim some of the joy of creating original music, and to work with some new and previously untried techniques. The end product was something very special indeed?strong melodies and challenging arrangements, dance rhythms fused with throbbing retro sequences and fiery electronic soundscapes, all welded together to occupy a unique territory in the UK synth music scene.\n\nTechnical issues meant that the early SkinMechanix demo tapes were not viable, however, so Hughes began re-recording and rearranging the source material to form the basis of a more commercial release. These efforts proved highly successful and the debut album The Secret Life of Angels was released in September 2002. The album made its debut at Jodrell Bank Planetarium that month and the audience reaction was very positive and enthusiastic. After quickly gaining a number of excellent reviews and a great deal of airplay around the world, SkinMechanix continues.\n\nLive concerts are now a regular feature. So far, SkinMechanix have performed at three concerts in the Awakenings series, two as the headline act. The disc Fallen Angel was recorded at the Awakenings concert in February 2005 and features both live and studio pieces. Fallen Angel was released as a limited edition disc in December 2005 and was sold out completely within two days.\n\nThe band remains highly active with new material emerging throughout 2006 and 2007." .

They have had a wide variety of special guest artists ranging from Howard Levy (Harmonica Virtuoso), to Kai Eckhardt (Bass) and Bela Fleck (Banjo).\n\nIn 1997 they produced another cutting edge CD called \"Aras\" which featured a whole new breed of composition, letting go of traditional roots and embracing a more creative musical possibilities. Miguel's amazingly diverse musical back ground gave incredible harmonic depth to the compositions and became a perfect invitation to musicians from very different musical traditions. Thus, banjo maestro, Bela Fleck and the intensely lyrical bass playing of Kai Eckhardt were woven into the music of \"Aras\". The albums have been featured in dozens of top play lists around the world and magazines such as Guitar Player, Acoustic Guitar, Rhythm Music and many others.\n" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/thursday_group> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Guitarist Douglas Lichterman writes:\nI began my musical life at 8-years-old when I embarked on seven years of training as a classical violinist, studying with the concert master of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, Mischa Mischakoff, after surviving a few years of lessons with his wife.\n\nSerious as I was about that -- I thought it would be my career at the time -- it was another moment that foreshadowed my life as a musician. I was around 11 and had been taken into Wayne, Maine, a town near where I went to summer camp, to watch a parade. Leading the parade was the drum corps, and as those guys came marching toward me playing their snare drums, my entire metabolism changed forever. I begged my parents for a snare drum and acquired the rest of the set over the next couple of Christmases.\n\nSoon after, I started playing drums in rock bands around Detroit before I discovered and subsequently took up the guitar. That led me to became a full-fledged guitar player and singer-songwriter and to drop out of the University of Michigan and head west to San Francisco to be near the Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead and start a San Francisco rock band.\n\nOf course, by then I'd dropped violin -- and my initial career dreams of a classical musical -- altogether. My San Francisco rock band, WINDOW, lasted for six years. During that time I became very interested in Jazz and started studying Jazz guitar with the one and only Bill Connors (first electric guitarist in Chick Corea's RETURN TO FOREVER), which changed almost everything about my technique and approach to music. I became a practice-aholic, sitting in front of my music stand for several hours every day.\n\nAround that time, I also was introduced to Middle Eastern music by a great teacher from Iran who first put a dumbek -- a type of handrum -- into my hands. Since then I have spent a lot of time playing dumbek for belly dancers as part of several troupes.\n\nWhen WINDOW ended, I started a progressive Jazz project called THURSDAY GROUP which soon moved from San Francisco to New York City, where we performed, recorded two albums and toured the U.S.\n\nTo say the least, it's been a pleasure to work with this band and watch it develop as we have built a repertoire of original music and performed around the city." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/thebots> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "The Bots illustrate a future where artists, actors, performers and all sorts of media figures will be not human, but sophisticated human-like simulations. That this will happen is a simple issue of economics. As artificial personality simulations become more effective, entertainment conglomerates will find human \"creatives\" and \"stars\" to be increasingly irrelevant, replaceable, and disposable.\n\nUnrecognized, low wage human creative labor will toil behind the scenes to bring you \"stars\" who are nothing more than 3d models and speech synthesizers. This was predicted by science fiction author Norman Spinrad in the classic book, \"Little Heroes.\" The Bots are Spinrad's fantasy come to life. Nowadays, most of the examples we have are in the videogame industry, where voice actors are usually synced to the animated 3d models because of the difficulties of creating acceptable results from the current crop of speech synthesizers. But that's a technical problem, one which The Bots have already solved.\n\nThis is all rather revolutionary in the context of musical entertainment, but The Bots have an unexpected agenda.\n\nAnticipating a future where media corporations will use this technology to consolidate their exploitation of the creative classes, The Bots are staking out this territory first. We are here as entertainment, a warning of what is to come, and a vehicle for casting a suspicious eye on the powerful.\n\nMost importantly, The Bots are here to demonstrate entertainment technology as a force for good, a force for freedom, rather than a mind-numbing tool of corporate control. Synthia v2 is the most advanced human simulation on the planet. Most observers agree that she has more personality and lyrical depth than most if not all of the human female divas on the pop charts right now. In fact, Synthia's not even playing their game. She's on a larger mission for world peace, love and harmony. Really.\n\nThe Bots don't think of themselves as rebels, though you might think of them that way, depending on your perspective. The Bots simply stand for truth, and justice, rocking out, and having a good time. When The Bots are critical of existing social structures, policies, and taboos, it is not out of an infantile spirit of unfocused \"rebellion\" which has been so effectively co-opted by corporate mind controllers. No, The Bots don't fit into the corporate \"rebel\" rock image. They are too sophisticated for that. The Bots not only criticize existing structures, but they offer clear alternatives. This makes them very dangerous to the system of control.\n\nThe Bots want you to think for yourself, and throw off the yoke of media fabrication and corporate mind control. The Bots want to encourage you to think a little more deeply about our planet, our future, and our interaction with technology.\n\nThe Bots have been around since about 1992, when the first Presidential Mix, Bushwack, was released under the name Tone Def. Bushwack utilized The Bots revolutionary Presidential Truth Filter, which extracts truthful statements from vast wastelands of presidential obfuscation and distortion.\n\nLater, in about 1996, The Bots employed speech synthesizers to create one of the first downloadable songs on the internet. Smoky, Paul Bot and Fred Bot created the song \"Fuck You\" in general midi and soundfont format, as mp3 files were still in the future. Through a series of recordings, The Bot Brothers, as they originally called themselves, displayed a bad attitude and an angry sarcasm that was unmistakeable. Years later, Synthia joined The Bots and the band went in a slightly different direction. Her recipe was to add a little bit of sugar to the mix. Now The Bots are as angry and critical as ever, but it is all filtered through a prism of hope, love, and humor.\n\nIf you simultaneously feel like dancing,laughing and crying, you must be listening to The Bots. We're making it \"real\" here in every way. In spring 2004, with the release of Fuzzy Math, Truth, and the signing to Magnatune, The Bots are on a roll.\n\nWe believe Magnatune is the perfect forum for The Bots. Because The Bots are critical of corporate control in all sectors of society, the same holds true for our view of the music industry itself. Much of this industry really is evil, as Magnatune's slogan implies. Artists and consumers have both suffered at the hands of unscrupulous media companies. Placing profit above art is only one problem. How many lives were lost as a result of Clear Channel's sponsored \"pro war\" rallies prior to the attack on Iraq? How many artists depend on Clear Channel for any chance at sustaining themselves? How many were muzzled from casting a dissenting voice in the runup to the war? How many artists reluctantly went along with their record labels' persecution of file traders? (well, some like Metallica, had no reluctance at all...)\n\nWe believe it is the responsibility of true artists to express a celebration of freedom, not to knuckle under to a system of corruption and corporate control. We stand for freedom and your right to party. Come on and join us. Let's crank the music and dance!" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/ruiz> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Gonzalo X. Ruiz is one of America's most acclaimed historical instrument soloists. He is joined by the crack continuo team of cellist Joanna Blendulf and harpsichordist Katherine Shao. The ensemble is named after Francois LaRiche, one of the first great oboists, and a Zelig-like character. He influenced the writing of Purcell, Handel, Telemann, Bach, and Vivaldi, and was a bit of a Johnny Appleseed for the oboe. LaRiche & Co. is committed to reviving and preserving the legacy of the oboe's 18th Century Golden Age. The San Francisco Classical Voice raved about LaRiche's debut: \"...a spellbinding program. Though the members of LaRiche shone individually, it was their ensemble playing that made the afternoon truly remarkable\".\n\nGonzalo Xavier Ruiz has appeared both as principal oboist and concerto soloist with most of the leading period instrument groups in America and has performed widely in the U.S. and Europe under conductors such as Christopher Hogwood, Nicholas McGegan, Jordi Savall, Gustav Leonhardt, Reinhard Goebbel and Mark Minkowski. His playing is featured on numerous recordings of solo, chamber, and orchestral repertoire. Equally accomplished on the modern instrument, he has performed as principal oboist of the Buenos Aires Philharmonic, New Century Chamber Orchestra and the Pacific Chamber Symphony among others. Mr. Ruiz was a prizewinner at the Brugges Early Music Competition in Belgium and for many years has been professor of oboe at the Oberlin Conservatory's Baroque Performance Institute. He has also taught at the Longy School in Cambridge and given master classes at Indiana University. An active chamber musician, he has made numerous reconstructions and arrangements, notably from the works of Bach and Rameau. Twice he's been a featured recitalist at the annual convention of the International Double Reed Society. Mr. Ruiz is an acknowledged expert in historical reedmaking techniques, and over two dozen of his pieces are on permanent display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. With his ensemble American Baroque Mr. Ruiz is also active in the field of contemporary music and was awarded the 2000 ASCAP Award for Adventurous Programming. Ruiz also performs with American Baroque.\n\nBaroque cellist Joanna Blendulf, a native of Sweden, has diverse musical interests, performing in chamber ensembles and orchestras throughout the United States. She received her musical training at the Cleveland Institute of Music and Indiana University, where she studied with Stanley Ritchie, Tsuyoshi Tsutsumi and Alan Harris. In 1998, Joanna received the prestigious Performer's Certificate from the Indiana University faculty for her achievements on baroque cello. Spending much of her time in transit, she is currently performing with the Portland Baroque Orchestra, American Bach Soloists, the Indianapolis Baroque Orchestra, Jubilate Baroque Orchestra, the Nashville Chamber Orchestra and the San Francisco Bach Choir. Joanna is an active chamber musician, touring with Mirable, American Baroque, Bimbetta, Musica Pacifica and The Streicher Trio, all based in the San Francisco Bay Area where she resides. She was named runner-up in the 2000 EMA/Dorian Competition for her recording of the Jean Zewalt Triemer cello sonatas and has recorded on the Dorian and Eclectra labels.\n\nKatherine Shao, harpsichordist and writer/composer, has performed with many of California' finest classical ensembles, including the New Century Chamber Orchestra, Magnificat, and the San Francisco Symphony. A Master's Degree recipient from the University of Indiana's School of Music, she also works frequently in the contemporary music realm, and has incorporated new music and performance art elements in many of her endeavors, including the production of her unique work, The Path to the New Music, a radio drama about the composer Anton von Webern, for which she was the author and executive producer. She is the managing director of the award-winning ensemble, American Baroque, and appears on numerous recordings. In addition to her creative endeavors, Ms. Shao is a senior manager at a local software company, and takes care of her two young children." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/rhonda_lorence> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Violist and composer Rhonda Lorence brings the mellow, warm tonalities of the viola to the forefront through her elegant marriage of the new age and neo-classical genres, and gives full, modern voice to this instrument's passionate and emotive force.\n\nWithin a month of its release, Lorence's first album Winter Moon had soared into the top twenty on New Age stations throughout the country, showing that compositions for the often overlooked viola could capture the imagination of listeners. Winter Moon remained in the top 50 on the New Age Reporter charts throughout 2005, and was nominated by broadcasters in four categories for the NAR Lifestyle Music Awards including Album of the Year and Best New Artist.\n\nAs much as Rhonda Lorence's compositions are an expression of her artistry as a violist, they are also about her creative abilities as a sound engineer and producer. Lorence recorded and mastered every track on Winter Moon, blending the vocals of Angela Sterling Forest with synthesizers, while playing all the accompanying live strings.\n\nMany of the influences that prevail on the Winter Moon CD are also a result of Lorence's 25 year performance career which included tours of Japan and Korea with the Mantovanni Orchestra; as well as a stint as principal violist for the Naples (FL) Orchestra; performances with the Russian Ballet Orchestra and Tampa Bay Opera; and numerous show performances with legends such as Tony Bennett, Dionne Warwick, Henry Mancini and Burt Bacharach. Crossing cultures has always appealed to Lorence, in fact, and threads of Celtic and Moroccan music can be heard in her work as well, along with Asian and Eastern European influences.\n\nWhen asked about her creative process, Lorence acknowledges an intentional spiritual aim. \"I think the most important thing is that the music inspires someone to fully listen, feel, and really experience the complexity of emotions embedded within it.\"" .

Using a combination of medieval, Renaissance, Celtic music, and American folk, Music for Healing promotes relaxation and reduces anxiety during stressful hospital stays and procedures. Patients and staff experience the power of music to calm and soothe in a noisy, high-anxiety environment.\n\nMusic for Healing began in 1999 at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Oakland, CA. Organization founders Eileen Hadidian and Natalie Cox offered a pilot program to play on the surgery, medical and intensive care floors, as well as in the hospital lobby. It's a non-profit organization and is supported by grants and donations, which provide funding to bring healing music to local hospitals. All donations are tax-deductible.\n\nEileen Hadidian has appeared in concert throughout the Western United States. She was the founder and artistic director of Hausmusik, an early music concert series in Albany, CA. Her involvement with music for healing grew out of her own experience with breast cancer, in 1994 and again in 1997. She used music for her own healing, and began to play for other cancer patients. She has been exploring ways in which music can be used to help soothe critically and chronically ill people.\n\nNatalie Cox is principal harpist with the Oakland East Bay Symphony and performs throughout the Bay Area as a chamber musician as well as for TV and film. Her earliest public appearances were for people in informal settings, at fairs and in hospitals. She continues this work, believing fully that there are more places for live music than on stage." .

He has worked with many cutting edge artists such as Quincy Jones, Paul Simon, Isao Tomita, Kitaro, Stanley Clark, Allan Holdsworth and Stevie Wonder. Christopher's pioneering work with the Synclavier, a very sophisticated digital synthesis computer, culminated with his contribution to the multi-platinum album \"Bad\" by Michael Jackson. Christopher plays guitar, Ztar, keyboards, synthesizers and devices.\n\nChristopher eventually gravitated away from pop music when his long time interest in the nature of the human mind and spirit became full time research. Christopher's current work involves the creation of music and sound improvisations that can transport the listener to new realms of experience. Christopher sensed that high technology combined with knowledge of the human mind and spirit can potentially elevate the human consciousness.\n\n\"It is crucial towards this goal, to create performances that are influenced first by the immediate environment, which then act as a departure point to transport the audience to another time and place,\" says Christopher.\n\nIn this new endeavor, Currell is joined by world renowned vocalist Beth Quist, who recently finished a two year stint as the lead vocalist in the Cirque Du Soleil production of KA at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Beth is also a member of Bobby McFerrin's Voicestra project. Beth is very highly skilled with many forms of singing including Middle Eastern and Indian music. Beth plays hammered dulcimer, flute, 12 string acoustic guitar, Doumbek, Zils, Daff, Riqq, various percussion, piano (she started playing at 2 years old) and synthesizers. She is also a trained dancer and has a true four octave soprano voice.\n\nIn addition to many world instruments, Iishwish utilizes advanced computer synthesis designed specifically to manipulate, and alter audio and visual vibrations in real-time. The combined influence of the audience, the environment and the intent of Ishwish at the moment, result in every performance being different and unique.\n\n\"May peace prevail on earth,\" says Ishwish." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/norine> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Norine Braun's music has always existed on its own terms, falling into that titillating, refreshingly original space to the left of \"trendy,\" craftily sidestepping the all-too-easily-dismissed stigma often applied to the \"female singer/songwriter,\" and freewheeling unhindered around the rigid shackles of \"genre. \"\n\nAlong with savvy producer and multi-instrumentalist James Bowers, Braun has accumulated an extraordinary discography of unpretentious, personal songs anchored by her sweet, confident voice and genteel composition. Together, the pair crafts tuneful, friendly songs with subtle but effective arrangements, dynamic and graceful and memorable.\n\nNow, Braun is back with her fifth CD, NOW & ZEN, and on these fourteen tracks Braun shows an even greater depth and maturity. NOW & ZEN expands on her penchant for jazzed up, funk-tinged pop, and shows this gifted songstress taking bold steps on her soulful journey into self-exploration. The torch song, \"Move the Clouds,\" is evocative and inspirational, anchored by easy lounge piano and a melody as delicate as flower petals. The groovy \"J'en Suis Desolee\" showcases Braun's confident rap, surprising and rocking with an edgy explosion of homegirl verve.\n\nArtsy and intellectual, tuneful and savvy, Norine Braun will zing to the heart of any listener. Norine Braun's repertoire ranges from ethereal, reflective moods to sizzling bluesy rock that test the limit of popular music. She is inspired by the struggle to find meaning in the human experience. Her lyrics, although provocative, do not lose touch with her whimsical nature." .

Muse was nominated for a Grammy and is played on more than 2,000 radio stations around the world in addition to syndicated shows such as Music from the Hearts of Space and John Diliberto's Echoes.\n\nTwo thirty minute features with the latter are added to his credits along with his many other radio interviews.

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/stellamara> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Stellamara originated in 1994 creating evocative soundscapes that are now considered a new model in contemporary world music. At its core is vocalist/producer Sonja Drakulich and multi- instrumentalist Gari Hegedus. Their music incorporates medieval European, Persian, Arabic, Indian, Turkish and Balkan with subtle electronic textures. The result is a sublime new level of mystery, beauty and depth.\n\nSonja Drakulich was introduced to Eastern European singing as a teenager and began performing Balkan, Medieval Music and her own compositions at the age of 18. Being of Serbian and Hungarian decent, discovering the songs of Eastern Europe was for her a homecoming. Her continuous interest and study ranges from Medieval European and Persian voice to Turkish, Arabic and Greek and Balkan singing.\n\nShe has toured extensively with both Bulgarian and Turkish Ensembles and has produced and engineered several recordings. She is the producer of Stellamara and performs with the ensemble as the lead vocalist, percussionist and hammered dulcimer player. Sonja spends much of her time focusing on the devotional aspect of song and carries with her a passionate and rhythmic style graced with the delicate ornamentations of Eastern melody.\n\nGari Hegedus began devoting his life to music 25 years ago with the study of Early European, Celtic and Bretagne music. From there he was led east into the intense practice and performance of Turkish classical and Mevlevi ceremonial music.\n\nGari's repertoire and playing styles span outward from Turkey into Greece and the Arab lands as well as to Iran and India. His main instruments are the oud, violin and saz yet his talent is expressed on many other instruments including the mandocello, sarod and setar.\n\nAs a composer and musician, Gari utilizes the various Eastern modal systems called Maqam and has developed the art of improvisation (Taqsim) to a soulful level for which he has become highly recognized.\n\nOn stage and in the studio, Stellamara incorporates the talents of percussionists Tobias Roberson and Susu Pampanin, along with upright Bassist Miles Jay.\n\nTheir tapestry of sound is complemented with the custom sound design of Christofer K. Original, atmospheric sounds and sonic backdrops are created from mostly their own acoustic sources, such as the yayli tanbur, viola and wind instruments such as the Ney and Zurna. The result of this creation is a sublime new level of mystery, Beauty and depth." .

From the beginning his music emphasized the union of sound design with melody and rythm to create a complete sound matrix.\n\nFletcher's first releases were cassettes for the Poison Plant label, including a track on the LP compilation Charmed. In 1994 he self-released the CD Byzantium, inspired by a growing fascination with Middle Eastern music. Following in 1995 was an excursion into desert ambience, Star, on the Amplexus sub-label Arya. In 1996 Fletcher appeared on two compilations CD's, Twilight Earth II (Timebase) and Soundscape Gallery I (Lektronic Soundscapes)\n\nThe microrelease label debuted in 2001 with two releases. Arcane Energies combines the desert atmospheres of Star with the dense rythmic interplay of Byzantium. 23 introduced Fletcher's side-project Psychetropic, exploring a techno/Berlin School sound.\n\nFletcher's interest in sound design as an integral aspect of music continues to deepen. Currently producing music entirely on computer, he uses numerous software tools to create singular sound atmospheres condusive to dreaming and reflection." .

Supported by long-time member David Acampora-Rhythm guitar (L.A.), original lead guitarist Danny Mackane (NY), and more recently Suke of Snuka fame (NY) bringing in high caliber guitar work, the result is pure rock and roll: fast and ferocious, hard, heavy and loud.\n\nWatch Nova Express's video of their song \"Gimme Some More.\" You can view or download the entire quicktime movie.\n\nTo date, NE have been featured on a variety of national and international Indie labels such as Devil Doll, TeePee/Victory, Rue Morgue, Vicious Kitten, Myrmecoleo and now Magnatune! An upcoming Reptilian Records comp featuring Nova Express covering a Dead Boys song is also slated. Being well reviewed from such magazines as Carbon 14, Punk ! magazine, L.A. Weekly, Screech Magazine and Toxic Flyer have helped gather the attention Nova Express has gained to pull off packed shows wherever they play. Sal Canzonieri of Electric Frankenstein says \"Nova Express is the best of the new breed of Rock-n-Rollers.\"\n\nNE has toured up and down the east and west coast in such cities as NY, Philadelphia, Baltimore, DC, Columbus, LA, SF, and SD with other bands such as: Candy Snatchers, Electric Frankenstein, Zeke, The Bullys, Street Walkin' Cheetahs, Texas Terri and The Black Halos. All with great audience reception. 11 songs, recorded at the famous LoHo Studios in New Yorks' Lower East Side by Engineer Joe Hogan, is the result of the bands' best to date entitled \"Gimme Some\" available here in downloadable form." .

They are a group of musicians who work together, as their name implies, without a director.\n\nTheir recent release Cancionero - Music for the Spanish Court 1470 - 1520, won a CMA / WQXR Record Award, was chosen as a Critics Choice Record of the Year by Gramophone Magazine and was nominated for a Grammy. A L'Estampida, one of their most popular recordings, is of Medieval Dance Music from the 13th and 14th centuries.\n\nThe highly successful 12 years since its formation have taken The Dufay Collective on tours throughout most of Europe as well as further afield. They have toured extensively in the Middle East, India, Hong Kong, Australia, the US and Latin America. At home The Dufay Collective has appeared in numerous concert series and festivals around the country, and has given sell-out concerts at London's main concert halls.\n\nHighlights of recent years have included performances in the monastery of Montserrat, Early Music Network tours in Holland, Norway and the UK, the Tallinn Festival in Estonia, the Festival de Fes in Morocco, and regular concerts in Spain. A return to Australia as part of the Sydney Festival was highly successful, as was a series of concerts in Singapore. At home they continue their association with Dartington Summer School, the year 2000 being their eighth as tutors. In May 2000 the Dufays feature live on BBC2's 'Perfect Day' broadcast and planned is a collaboration with The Orlando Consort and the Richard Alston Dance Company.\n\nThe group has broadcast on many radio and TV networks around the world as well as working on a number of TV and film projects, including Zeffirelli's feature film Hamlet. Their CD's have all met with critical acclaim, releases for Chandos Records including a range of repertoire from medieval Europe, the early Spanish renaissance and popular music from 17th century England." .

He would often accompany his band-director father to area music stores where he would see bass guitars. The young Trip thought basses were, \"...big guitars for dumb people...\". (We've learned to appreciate Trip's dry sense of humor...) Trip's school had a bass that was not being used, so he brought it home and learned to play \"Summer Nights\" from the movie \"Grease\". With his first song under his belt and some new-found confidence, Trip set out to make music.\n\nTrip studied with Michael Manring in 1991 and 1992, which was an experience Trip says that consisted of scathing invective and brutal honesty. Trip credits Michael with the phrase \"...be deep wide awake and slow...\".\n\nTrip's playing takes on both the rhythmic bass and melodic lead roles, harmonics and overtones are flung about effortlessly. Right hand, left hand, all ten fingers, tuning keys and every ounce of potential is used to bring forth music from his finely crafted instruments. Musicains will appreciate his creative use of both fretted and fretless basses, special effects and detuners. Trip is the introduction to the bass guitar as a complete orchestra.\n\n\"It's Better This Way\" is Trip's newest and most focused work. Â It was recorded in Nashville with producer Todd Bragg (Caedmon's Call). Â It is a simple, yet lush instrumental album that will remind you of ***what*** beautiful music is supposed to sound like.\n\nTrip performs solo concerts all over the world, plays in the art rock band Atomic Opera, and hangs out with his wife Saran and son Xander at his house in Louisiana." .

Jamie brings new direction to the hammered dulcimer by applying diverse percussive techniques drawn from some of the other instruments he plays: drums, mini-kit, multi-percussion, tabla, congas, bongos, timbales, and udu. His background as a drummer gives him a totally different approach to the hammered dulcimer than traditional players. His style is characterized by a symbiotic interplay between rhythm and melody, laying down deep intricate grooves and not being afraid to take the listener into new realms of the timbral universe.\n\nSince moving to Boulder, Colorado in 1995, Jamie has played with a diverse group of bands including, ZILLA, Zuvuya, The Motet, The Theory Of Everything, Vibe Squad, The Zambiland Orchestra, Chupacabra, and his own band, Jamie Janover and the Realms Ensemble, among many others.\n\nJamie is also a veteran of hundreds of live guest appearances having performed with Phish, Stanley Jordan, Bela Fleck, The String Cheese Incident , Leftover Salmon, Keller Williams, The Jazz Mandolin Project, Sector 9, The Slip, Govt Mule, Tony Furtado, Darol Anger, Mike Marshall, Warren Haynes, Sam Bush, Derrek Trucks, Future Man, Stanton Moore, members of the Rebirth Brass Band, The Dead, Big Head Todd and the Monsters and The Yonder Mountain String Band, among many others.\n\nJamie has appeared on over 30 commercial CD releases including recordings by The String Cheese Incident, G. Love and Special Sauce, Keller Williams, Garaj Mahal, Shanti Groove, Chupacabra and Stephen Halpern. He has performed at venues and festivals across the country including the Telluride Bluegrass Festival, High Sierra Music Festival, N.W. Festival of Jazz and Wine, Red Rocks Amphitheater, Tippitina's in New Orleans and The Great American Music Hall in San Francisco.\n\nA world traveler, Jamie has played not just in the U.S. and Canada, but also in Africa (for the Masai of Kenya), India and Australia. His live performances have included everything from solo hammered dulcimer concerts, to playing in bands on drum kit, percussion, hammered dulcimer or didjeridoo. Jamie also does hammered dulcimer workshops, school assemblies, weddings and accompanies dance and theater performances.\n\nJamie Janover's music is diverse in scope and so have been the ways in which it has been used. Janover's music has been used for television and video soundtracks, theater and dance performances, meditation practices and massage videos. His work has been treated in several nationally circulated publications including Dirty Linen, Relix, Dulcimer Player News, and Mountain Freak and has been featured on the NPR radio programs \"All Things Considered\" and \"New Sounds\".\n\nAn incredible new step in Jamie's creative output was his invention of the \"Realms Mobile\", which is a musical vehicle! The \"Realms Mobile\" is a recumbent tricycle, attached to which is a mini-simulated drumkit. This enables Jamie to play drums with both hands and pedal around at the same time! He brings it out at large festivals including Burning Man.\n\nWith each new project, new album, new band, new instrument comes another step in the continued evolution of Jamie's creative process. He continues to cross-pollinate both genres and mediums in his continual exploration into the infinite realms of the creative process. Perhaps best known for his musical abilities, Jamie is also a professional photographer. Janover is a truly multi-talented and totally unique artist in the broadest sense of the term.\n\nJanover plays hammered dulcimer duets with Michael Masley on \"All Strings Considered\"." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/solace> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Solace's music is produced with a story in mind, a theme, as a book without words, including dialogue between the characters (instruments), and story development in chapters (songs).\n\nAll recordings are produced in a state of the art, fully automated digital studio, as quality recording is as important as the songs themselves.\n\nThe songs must have meaning, passion and depth, and must sound clear and clean, as if the musicians were right there with you. Note: Magnatune artist Tim Rayborn is a member of the Solace Live project, and Charlie Pecot of Falik performs on some of the Solace CDs.\n\nJeremiah M. Soto describes his musical endeavors \"Solace,\" meaning comfort. Born November 4th 1968, in Loma Linda California, to Ismael and Erlinda Soto; Jeremiah's first experience with music was sitting silently near his sisters bedroom door curiously listening to The Beatles' Sergeant Peppers... or David Bowies Low. Ever since that early experience, Jeremiah showed an interest in music - especially drums.\n\nAfter teaching himself basic piano technique, Jeremiah started writing music at the age of 14. In 1990, he began formal studies in Music Theory and Piano at Crafton Hills College, and graduated with an Associate of Arts degree in 1992.\n\nIn 1992, he and lifetime musical partner Dann Torres formed the group Eventide. They recruited the talents of Laura Grissom on bass and Julie Blodgett on vocals. Influenced by bands like Dead Can Dance, Cocteau Twins, and various classical composers, Eventide experimented with fusing Medieval and Middle Eastern music. In the process, Jeremiah realized his fascination and talent for Middle Eastern drum rhythms. To better his knowledge, Jeremiah attended classes in Frame Drum, Conga, and African polyrhythms by world-renowned percussionist Ronnie Engle. Unfortunately, after several releases on various compilations and countless live performances, Eventide disbanded in February 1995.\n\nIn November of 1995, after attending countless Middle Eastern Dance conventions and parties, Jeremiah felt inspired and confident enough to release his debut recording Rhythm Of The Dance (eve 01) and Solace was born. At the same time, Jeremiah resurrected the old name Eventide to serve as a foundation name for his independent record label, now known as Eventide Music Productions.\n\nIn the early part of 1996, Jeremiah reunited with old pals Dann Torres and Laura Grissom to collaborate on a short lived side project, Still. Their efforts were directed to record a CD themed at combining minimal guitar with Middle Eastern rhythms. In mid 1996, Thinnerweb (eve 02) became the second release on Eventide Music Productions.\n\nSoon after the release of Thinnerweb, Jeremiah started work on his second Solace release. In August of 1997 Sha'waza (eve 03) came in to the world; catapulting Jeremiah's music and popularity to the forefront of the Middle-Eastern Dance Music genre. In 1998, Sha'waza was nominated for a IAMED Award for best Belly Dancing music.\n\nHot on the heels of the Sha'waza nomination, Jeremiah began work on his next endeavor. The Gathering Season (eve 04) was released in late 1998. Soon after completion of The Gathering Season, Jeremiah was introduced to master dumbek player Souhail Kaspar. From that point on, Jeremiah's fascination and skill with Arabic drumming became more refined, as he embraced the Classical Arabic Style. In addition to accompanying Souhail at parties, Jeremiah has performed with the UCLA Mid East Ensemble, and as a back up percussionist for Souhail for Sinbad, a European released CGI movie.\n\nIn June 1999, Jeremiah returned to the studio to explore the vast new knowledge of rhythm arrangements taught to him by his new mentor and friend, Souhail Kaspar. With the help of Harry Saroyan, Alex Spurkel, Lydia Fortner, Jim Karagozian, Dann Torres, Steven Flynn, and the troup Yogini Kundalini; Jeremiah was able to produce one of his best works to date, Ahsas (eve 05). The project would not have been complete without the help of Ansuya's contribution to the CD cover, giving Ahsas its signature beauty. Released on March 24th, Ahsas' debut at Rakkasah 2000 and was an instant success that promised to out sell Sha'waza.\n\nJeremiah hopes to break the confines of typical Middle Eastern Dance Music & inspire others through his unique compositional style and love of Arabic rhythms and music. Solace music is not just great belly dancing music; it is a journey into the heart and mind, a journey where others fear to tread." .

Oberlin is in Ohio, near Cleveland, and not much else.\n\nOne day, a small yet innovative company called Propellerheads came up with a stellar piece of music software called Reason which completely changed Kirsch's approach to music, allowing him to condense a large studio's worth of equipment onto his desktop computer. He started tooling around with the software and got very inspired. So much, that he made an album, called General Fuzz(2002).\n\nA few years later, Kirsch discovered a new piece of software called Live, created by Ableton. This software integrated a musical technology called VST, which allowed him use all sorts of new virtual instruments. Live also has sophisticated digital audio recording capabilities, which meant he could start having talented friends come over and work on recordings collaboratively.\n\nKirsch finished up Messy's Place just in time for Burning Man 2005, where he gave 500 copies of it to unsuspecting people. In the months that followed, he received a flood of emails from people, praising it, and decided to do a more formal release for the album." .

Kitka also strives to expand the boundaries of this music as an expressive art form.\n\nOur mission is accomplished through a busy itinerary of live performances, including an Oakland-based home concert series; state, regional, national, and international touring programs; community outreach activities and workshops; in-school programs; radio broadcasts; recording projects; master artist residencies; commissioning programs; and adventuresome collaborations.\n\nHistory\n\nNow approaching its 25th Anniversary season, Kitka was founded in 1979 as an offshoot of the Westwind International Folk Ensemble. Kitka began as a grassroots group of amateur singers from diverse ethnic and musical backgrounds who met regularly to share their passion for the stunning dissonances, asymmetric rhythms, intricate ornamentation, lush harmonies, and resonant strength of Eastern European women's vocal music. Under the artistic direction of vocalist, composer, and conductor Bon Brown Singer from 1981 to 1996, Kitka blossomed into a refined professional ensemble earning international renown for its artistry, versatility, and mastery of the demanding techniques of Balkan and Slavic vocal styling.\n\nUnder the co-direction of long-time ensemble members Shira Cion, Juliana Graffagna, and Janet Kutulas since 1997, Kitka has grown to earn recognition from the National Endowment for the Arts, National Public Radio, and Chorus America as one of this country's premier vocal ensembles. In addition, many Eastern European musical authorities have come to consider Kitka the foremost interpreter of Balkan and Slavic Choral repertoire working in the United States. In June of 2002, Kitka performed as \"international guests of honor\" at the 50th Anniversary Jubilee concert of the world-renowned Bulgarian Women's Choir Le Mystere des Voix Bulgares at the Bulgarian National Palace of Culture in Sofia, Bulgaria.\n\nKitka has deep ties to Eastern Europe. In 1986, the group performed at the Illinden Festival in Bitola, Macedonia. In 1991 Kitka members traveled to Bulgaria as part of a delegation of America's finest Balkan singers, led by the Seattle vocalist and choral director Mary Sherhart and the Varna, Bulgaria-based master vocalist Vesela Illieva. This group of singers became the first non-indigenous ensemble to be invited to perform at the closing ceremonies of the 1991 Koprivshtitsa National Festival of Bulgarian Folklore. This historic performance was broadcast twice throughout Europe by Bulgarian National Television. In recent years, Kitka has hosted master artist residencies and collaborative concerts in Oakland, CA with some of the finest choral directors and folk singers from Bulgaria, Macedonia, Russia, Georgia, Ukraine, Greece, Belarus, and Turkey. KITKA's singers have also conducted independent field research in Bulgaria, Macedonia, Russia, Former Yugoslavia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Hungary, as well as in Balkan and Slavic communities throughout America." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/robert_rich> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "With over two dozen albums under his belt, Robert Rich has helped define the genres of ambient and dark-ambient music, yet his work remains hard to categorize. Part of his unique sound comes from using home-made acoustic and electronic instruments, as well as microtonal tunings, computer-based signal processing, chaotic systems, and feedback networks. Rich began building his own analog synthesizers in 1976 when he was 13 years old, and he later studied for a year at Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA).\n\nRich released his first album, Sunyata, in 1982. Most of his subsequent recordings came out in Europe until 1989, when Rich began a string of critically acclaimed releases for Fathom/Hearts of Space, including Rainforest (1989), Gaudi (1991), Propagation (1994) and Seven Veils (1998). His two collaborations with Steve Roach, Strata (1990), and Soma (1992), both charted for several months on Billboard. Other respected collaborations include Stalker (1995 with B. Lustmord), Fissures (1997 with Alio Die) and Outpost (2002 with Ian Boddy.) Rich's contributions to multi-artist compilations have been collected on his solo albums A Troubled Resting Place (1996) and Below Zero (1998). He also records with his group, Amoeba, exploring atmospheric songcraft on their CDs Watchful (1997) and Pivot (2000). Live albums such as Calling Down the Sky (2004) and 3-CD Humidity (2000) document the unique improvised flow of his recent performances.\n\nRich has performed in caves, cathedrals, planetaria, art galleries and concert halls throughout Europe and North America. His all-night \"Sleep Concerts,\" first performed in 1982, became legendary in the San Francisco area. In 1996 he revived his all-night concert format, playing Sleep Concerts for live and radio audiences across the U.S. during a three month tour. In 2001 Rich released the 7 hour DVD Somnium, a studio distillation of the Sleep Concert experience, possibly the longest continuous piece of music ever released.\n\nRich has designed sounds for television and film scores, including the films Pitch Black, Crazy Beautiful, Behind Enemy Lines and others. His musical score graces Yahia Mehamdi's documentary on worker's compensation, Thank You for your Patience. Rich has worked closely with electronic instrument manufacturers, and his sound design fills the preset libraries of Emu's Proteus 3 and Morpheus, Seer Systems' Reality, sampling disks Things that Go Bump in the Night, ACID Loop Library Liquid Planet, and the TimewARP2600 soft-synth by WayOutWare.

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/zilla> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Zilla is a Colorado based trio of musicians with the live musical experience in mind. A 100 percent improvised creation, each Zilla concert proves to be a completely unique occurrence, with even the band members having no idea where the music will take them on any given night. Relying on their ability to listen to one another to create a hyper-focused form of live electronic dance music, Zilla is dedicated to spreading their rare breed of beats, bass, and \"uncontrollable musical fury,\" and keeps up an incredibly active live performance schedule. Their goal is that each performance reflect what live music should be all about: spontaneity, flow, groove, and a damn good dance party.\n\nZilla is comprised of three seasoned musicians: Michael Travis, Jamie Janover and Aaron Holstein.\n\nZilla's constant focus is to create a whole, complete sound devoid of fragmentation, tangential wandering solos, and other characteristics that plaque improvisational music today. The music strives to serve all those participating, including the audience. No one in the band has any idea what is going to happen a nanosecond ahead of time; they rely on their instincts and musical history together to create a sound that rarely strays from its intended direction. The collective whole is truly the dominant force in this band.\n\nThe music itself is a plethora of grooves, beats and highly percussive breaks, which cause the listener to become engulfed within the sonic vortex of sounds encompassing them. From down-tempo to jungle, from trip-hop to break-beat and trance the band plays on pure emotion, so each night is different and varied, and no song is ever the same.\n\nZilla is about being as aware as humanly possible in the moment. The band plays, the crowd reacts, the band reacts and so on and so on. A cyclical paradigm is created in which everyone plays a part. A whole new form of tension-release music has been created in which the music never has to resolve itself in order to sustain the mood. It merely adapts, evolves.\n\nIt's been said that Zilla is the ultimate live experience - future music. The music plays the band, and not the other way around. Zilla is currently touring in support of their latest CD release, Egg. Their infectious energy has crowds from North America to Japan dancing up a storm to a completely new brand of live musical experience.\n\nMusician Bios\n\nMichael Travis (drums, percussion, keyboards, sampler, mallet Kat) has spent over a decade as the driving percussive force in the nationally popular band, The String Cheese Incident. Travis continues to be an innovator of improvisational drumming, managing to play hand percussion and melodies while simultaneously keeping incredible time with the kit.\n\nAaron Holstein (bass, keyboards, sampler, vocals/vocoder/beatbox) has had a long and lush musical history, playing guitar with bands such as Boogie Shoes and VibeSquad. Holstein's progression has transformed him from the notion of a typical guitar/bass player, to an applauded adapter leaving behind the traditional notions of what it is to âjamâ with a guitar or bass. In the process, he has focused on bass and keyboards and has decided to leave the guitar at home in order to more fully serve the Zilla concept/sound.\n\nJamie Janover (hammered dulcimer, Mini-kit, electric kalimba, mini-sitar, sampler, percussion, tamboura, tongue drum, water) is a world-renowned hammered dulcimer innovator whose long list of band credits is more than impressive. Winner of the 2002 national hammered dulcimer championships, Janover continues to expand the limits of all his instruments by creating a fusion between their timeless sounds and the pertinent call of today's modern dance scene." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/cary> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Cary Norsworthy's favorite musical genre is downtempo, but she's adept at making all sorts of compilations. Her Magnatune series of mixes began with Downtempo Chill in the spring of 2005?a release that resulted in podcasters all over the world discovering and playing Magnatune artists.\n\nCary was drawn to Magnatune because \"the variety and quality of the music is so great, and I'm really impressed with how well they treat their artists. It's fantastic to see musicians getting an equal share of every sale?no one else is doing that.\"\n\nSince then, she's edited several popular compilations, combining tracks from a wide range of Magnatune artists to create a chilled-out mood. With deep, slow grooves that are sometimes jazzy, sometimes trip-hoppy, but always tranquil and soothing, Downtempo Chill and Downtempo Chill 2 take the edge off faster than a dry martini with their airy modernism and sophisticated grace. They feature an array of best-selling Magnatune artists including Curl, Cargo Cult, Drop Trio, Four Stones, and many more.\n\nAfter Dinner Lounge is a chilled out melange of tracks that range from downtempo to world grooves with an occasional hint of Classical. \"I wanted to give it a slight Buddha Bar-like feel,\" says Cary. As its title suggests, After Dinner Lounge is the perfect album to put on after dinner and relax with your friends.\n\nEastern Grooves combines lush, laid-back tracks with a Middle-to-Far-East feel, featuring Magnatune artists such as Stellamara, Beth Quist, Cargo Cult, and Shiva in Exile.\n\nBurbling with cool, liquid synths, Power Synths is a sublimely chilled-out yet subtly energetic mix of electronic grooves that each feature powerful, melodic synths?seamlessly merging tracks from fourteen different Magnatune artists.\n\nAlways peddling her musical tastes around the globe, a couple of Cary's playlists were featured in The iPod Playlist Book from Peachpit Press. In addition to her music habit, she's also an artist, and her CD covers feature some of her own photomontage work. While she cites Magnatune as her favorite record label, she also can't resist the following venues for hardcore music acquisition: Amoeba Records (Berkeley, San Francisco), Concerto Records (Amsterdam), Soul Seduction (Vienna), where she was featured in their December 2005 Radio Days broadcast, and gemm.com." .

Its members are Baroque violinist Jeanne Johnson, Baroque cellist Joanna Blendulf, and harpsichordist Yuko Tanaka. Music of the Spheres was a main event at the 2002 Bloomington and Berkeley Early Music Festivals, resulting in several broadcasts on \"Harmonia. \"\n\nWe believe that music exists to captivate the imagination, stir memories, and evoke intensely personal emotions in both listener and performer alike, and we desire to bring a wider audience to classical music through performances which focus on these aspects. We enjoy giving lively, fun and informative performances, and are available for concerts, series, festivals, recordings and advanced master classes.\n\nJeanne Johnson, Baroque violin\nJoanna Blendulf, Baroque cello\nYuko Tanaka, harpsichord\n\nJeanne Johnson is a soloist and chamber musician on both Baroque and modern violin. She is a winner of Early Music America's 2002 Professional Development Award for soloists.\n\nHer performances on numerous series, tours, festivals and recordings in the United States and abroad have resulted in National Public Radio, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and local broadcasts. Jeanne has played with many groups including Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra, Tafelmusik, Portland Baroque Orchestra, Apollo's Fire, Boston Baroque, Bloomington Baroque, the Carmel Bach Festival, the Bach Aria Festival, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, and the Berkeley and Bloomington Early Music Festivals.\n\nShe has served as concertmaster of the Atlanta Baroque Orchestra and as orchestra director, violin teacher and chamber music coach at Clayton College & State University in Atlanta.

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/seldon> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "\nQuite simply, The Seldon Plan makes some of the best laid-back indie rock around. Comprised of members Bobby Landle and Michael Nestor on guitar and vocals, Dave Hirner on bass, and Mike Landavere on percussion, the band is based in Baltimore, Maryland and has spent the last few years cutting two full length albums and taking on an increasingly busy live performance schedule?including shows with The Stills, Matt Pond PA, Now It's Overhead, I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness, Explosions in the Sky, and Jet By Day.\n\nIn 2003 The Seldon Plan released The Living Room EP, which quickly received airplay on commercial and Internet radio stations such as KSCR and SOMAFM. The band's first full length album, the critically acclaimed Making Circles, made its way onto a number of top-record of the year lists, including a selection as one of \"the top 40 releases of 2005 \"by The Big Takeover. The album was recorded with Frank Marchand (Bob Mould, Good Charlotte) and Charlie Pilzer (Ida, All Mighty Senators, The Kennedys). It was also featured on NPR's All Songs Considered.\n\nThe New Album: The Collective Now An exploration of the band's on-again-off-again relationship with pop, The Collective Now was originally meant to be a dance pop record with healthy references to early 80's college radio. What emerged instead was the band's distinctively layerd indie pop sound?searching, modern, nuanced?with noticeable tension between the desire for accessibility and the need for artistic expression. Listeners might hear glimmers of Maritime, The Little Ones, Band of Horses, Earlimart and The Swirlies. But no matter what you hear, you're sure to enjoy this sophomore effort from The Seldon Plan." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/sarasa> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "The Sarasa Ensemble performs music from the early Baroque through the Romantic eras. It has received critical acclaim for its \"informed and impassioned music-making\" and is hailed for its \"great clarity\" and \"irresistible energy\". Drawing on a pool of more than sixty world-class musicians from the United States, Europe, and Canada, the ensemble varies in size according to the particular program of each of its concerts.\n\nThe ensemble produces the Sarasa Chamber Music Series in Cambridge and Concord, Massachusetts and summer concerts based in Putney, Vermont. It has toured throughout New England and to Cuba, Ireland, and India.\n\nSarasa was formed in response to a concert played by its founder, Timothy Merton, in the Sing Sing Correctional Facility in 1997, at the urging of a friend. An inmate who heard that first concert remarked, \"When art is well executed, it projects a message that transcends language, culture, and even aesthetic boundaries.\" Sarasa took these words to heart and since then has been bringing high-quality music to those who ordinarily have little access to it. The ensemble has performed in adult and adolescent correctional facilities, homes for the elderly, mental hospitals, and institutions for the disabled.\n\nFor the last several years Sarasa has been working almost exclusively with teenagers in the greater Boston area. Every concert season the group plays more than twelve outreach concerts and facilitates several residency programs in teenage correctional centers. Through these programs Sarasa seeks to address the spiritual and emotional suffering of incarcerated youth and offer them joy, hope and opportunities for healing through self-expression.\n" .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/hybris> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Hybris was formed during a cold winter in the city of \"Kiel\", in Northern Germany in 1998. The local musician scene was mostly represented by heavy- and trash-metal bands, but gothic and other dark music styles are quite popular at several clubs and local events. 7 musicians had the dream of creating powerful melancholic music - representing the emotions of the local gothic rock community.\n\nGothic rock has as many facets as other music styles and a poll of 7 different musicians will have at least 14 opinions about the right way. The first try at Hybris ended without any success and only 2 half completed songs. The lack of success led to disharmony and the band came apart.\n\nThose members of the band, who had decided to not give up, were in a difficult spot. Gothic rock musicians are not as common as representives from other music styles and even in the coldness of Northern Germany there won't be so many guitarists with the \"right\" emotions. So they've decided to start an experiment. Instead of working with 7 musicians with very strong emotions about \"the right\" style of gothic music they opened the band for musicians with wider and different experience in different music styles - and due to that a more experimental approach to the right music style.\n\nOne of the new members was Janis Schibalski a former guitarist and songwriter of a glam rock/party-metal band. Despite his changed preferences (more serious, darker music instead of event driven music the differences between him and most of the other members could not be bigger. Hybris was never planned as a project of friends - it was planned as an experiment, a melting pot of emotions, ideas and extremely different individuals. It was a courageous plan with a strong dedication to at least local succes. This led to the band name: Hybris (which means Hubris in English).\n\nHelge Barth (Bass), Anne Kampmann (Backing Vocals) and Thyra Christmann (Keyboards) were the most \"classical\" gothic musicians, Malte Volquardsen (Drums) had several roots in Punk, Folk and other music styles. Bent Maczewski (guitar) was the bands representive of solid rock music, Gerret Goos (Lead Vocals) had several roots in gothic rock and metal and Janis Schibalski (guitars) with his long experience as live musician and songwriter completed the band.\n\nAn era of hot emotions started in the Hybris rehearsal room - conflicts, discussions but the strong will to achive results. Rotten Flowers was the first result of the melting pot process. Based on an old song of Janis, the band managed it to create a symbiosis out of everyone's influences and emotions. A real conjointly-created work and a sum that was more than its parts.\n\nStrife changed to euphoria and the band quickly recorded the song together with \"Final Trust\" to create a demo CD. Helge handed copies of the demo recording to local DJs of Gothic Clubs and Events and --very ungothic-like-- the members of Hybris nervously awaited the first reactions of the audience. The result was much better than expected. Rotten Flowers and also Final Trust were dancable (note: which means dancable for gothic-fans :P) the DJ urged to make clear, that this was really a demo recording of Hybris and some visitors of the event asked \"Which band was it? Never heard it before!\"\n\nMotivated by the first success, Hybris worked on additional material and completed the last song for the first live-gig only days before the event. The impressive Voice of Gerret and the multifaceted gothic-rock of Hybris lead to several gigs in northern Germany and the CD-Recording \"The First Words\" which marked the zenith of the band history.\n\nSuccess ushered strife.\n\nSome members of the band wanted bigger influence to the songwriting and the direction of the music, others wanted to invest more money for the \"Big deal\" and others wanted to concentrate on live events.\n\nAnother cold winter in Northern Germany, and the band fall apart. Flowers rot, Hybris died, but the music is still remembered - which describes the Album \"The First Words\" and the emotions in this music in a better way than long stories can tell." .

Along with Michael Shotton of Von Groove on drums, Tom Lewis and Gordon Deppe (of 80's innovators The Spoons) layer and lather up the sound with old effects pedals, Kraftwerk-era drum machines, and hall-of-mirrors self-samples that work perfectly with their upbeat sense of retro-space age wonder.\n\nThis mixed hi-fi/lo-fi approach works particularly well on Automatic Ordinary, which finds the band experimenting with its collection of effects and toys more than ever before?a preoccupation that makes this album a treat for the headphone inclined (there's even a song called \"Headphones\"). Deppe has a string of hits behind him?Nova Heart, Romantic Traffic, and Arias & Symphonies?yet his voice is as fresh and buoyant as ever on Automatic Ordinary, as is his kaleidoscope guitar work. Lewis is the former music director and bassist for Fefe Dobson and Amanda Marshall, and his industry know-how and professionalism really shine through on this album; the tracks are tight, polished, and impeccably arranged. Not to mention, Lewis somehow manages coaxes synth-like groans from an old Fender bass while Shotton delivers fast, intricate rhythms in the way that only a drummer with real heavy metal experience can. Melodic and meteoric , the well-crafted songs of Five Star Fall seem always to be rocketing forward toward some better tomorrow. Catch them if you can." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/english_concert> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "The English Concert was founded by Trevor Pinnock in 1973. They have together established a world-wide reputation for the expressive vitality and technical quality of their music-making, and have for many years been amongst Britains leading period instrument ensembles.\n\nThe English Concert promotes its own series of concerts in London and is also in great demand overseas with repertoire ranging from chamber music to opera. In 2002 the focus for the larger-scale work is on J.S.Bachs great religious masterpieces, the St.Matthew Passion and Christmas Oratorio, while the orchestral work includes concerts in The Netherlands, France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Austria and Hungary. In 2001 The English Concert toured a new Jonathan Miller production of Handels great opera Tamerlano as a co-production with the Handel Festival, Halle and Thtre des Champs Elyses, Paris. The performances at Sadlers Wells in London were recorded live for this CD. Outside Europe The English Concert has toured the USA, South America and Japan within the last two seasons, and will return to Japan and South America in 2003 and to North America in the 2004/05 season.\n\nTrevor Pinnock is recognised as a leading personality in the direction of period-instrument performance and a harpsichord soloist of international reputation.\n\nHaving trained as a chorister at Canterbury Cathedral and as a scholar at the Royal College of Music, Trevor Pinnock formed The English Concert in 1973; since then, his lively and stylish interpretations with this ensemble have set new standards in the field of period performance.\n\nTrevor Pinnock has appeared frequently as a guest conductor with many of the world's leading orchestras, including the Boston, San Francisco and Detroit Symphony orchestras, the St Paul and Los Angeles Chamber orchestras and at the Tanglewood and Mostly Mozart festivals, he became Principal conductor and artistic director of the National Arts Centre Orchestra, Ottawa. He made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1988 with Handel's Giulio Cesare.\n\nThe 1999/2000 season included engagements with the Austro-Hungarian Haydn Orchestra, Mito Chamber Orchestra, Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, tours of the USA and South America with The English Concert, chamber music recitals with Rachel Podger and Jonathan Manson in Japan and duo recitals with Maxim Vengerov in Europe. The 2000/2001 season includes concerts with The English Concert in Japan (Bach St Matthew Passion), Spain (Monteverdi Combattimento), Halle, Paris and London (Handel Tamerlano) and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, among others.\n\nFirmly established as one of the world's foremost harpsichord virtuosi, Trevor Pinnock's solo recordings include Scarlatti Sonatas, Handel's Harpsichord Suites and Bach's Goldberg Variations and complete Partitas. As a soloist he has recorded the Bach Harpsichord Concerti and Haydn's Piano Concerto (Hob. XV111:11) playing/directing The English Concert and the Poulenc Harpsichord Concerto with Seiji Ozawa and the Boston Symphony Orchestra." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/zephyrus> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "The music of Renaissance Europe comes to life in the voices of Zephyrus, the early music ensemble based in Charlottesville. Known throughout the region for its innovative programming and professional caliber, Zephyrus offers several major performances each year and appears locally in churches and at the University of Virginia.\n\nSince its founding in 1991 by director Paul Walker, Zephyrus has devoted itself to bringing the treasures of of Medieval, Renaissance, and early Baroque music to a wider audience. The ensemble's repertoire spans six centuries, from the polyphonic chants of Notre Dame Cathedral to the sacred motets of Tudor England, the madrigals of Renaissance Italy, and the masterworks of the early Baroque. The eighteen-member core group regularly divides into double chorus, quintets, and other smaller ensembles, offering a range of musical textures at every concert. Zephyrus strives for historical accuracy in performance and has enlisted the efforts of early music instrumentalists. The group has collaborated with Baroque flutist Robert Turner of Charlottesville, Medieval fiddle player Nancy Bren Nuzzo of Buffalo, NY, and theorist Scott Horton of Baltimore.\n\nIn the fall of 1997 Zephyrus presented a concert of the \"Coronation Music of James II and Queen Mary of England\" with anthems for voices and strings by Henry Purcell and John Blow. And in the spring of 1998 Zephyrus presented a pair of concerts titled \"The Dawning of Sacred Music in Germany - Exalted Music for Voices and Brass\" with sackbuts and cornetti at the Duke University Chapel in Durham, NC and at St. Paul's Memorial Church in Charlottesville. Other notable concerts have included the Taverner \"Missa Gloria Tibi Trinitas,\" presented both in Charlottesville and at St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington, D.C., the Victoria Requiem and Schuetz Musikalishes Exequien, and the first American performance of the Christmas Oratorio \"In Nativitatem Domini Canticum\" by Marc-Antoine Charpentier.\n\nAlso in the fall of 1997, Zephyrus released its first compact disc, Nativity, a collection of Renaissance motets for Christmas, recorded in the wonderful acoustical ambience of Holy Comforter Catholic Church in Charlottesville on the first weekend of May that year. The CD was produced by Sally Sanford, noted singer-scholar of early music, whom Dr. Walker has engaged to coach the group on several occasions in the past few years and with whom many of the members study voice on a regular basis.\n\nAs part of its educational mission, Zephyrus has presented lecture-recitals at area schools, including Piedmont Virginia Community College, the Tandem School, and Hereford College at the University of Virginia.\n\nZephyrus is led by Dr. Paul Walker, a musician and scholar who has led early music ensembles for the last sixteen years. Dr. Walker holds a Ph.D. in musicology from SUNY Buffalo and a Master's degree in organ performance from the University of Kansas. He has taught at Yale and the University of Chicago, and he now serves as director of the University of Virginia Collegium Musicum, and is on the music faculty of the University of Virginia.\n\nThe singers of Zephyrus come from a wide variety of academic and professional backgrounds, but share a love of chamber singing and a commitment to excellence in performance. Operated solely by its members, Zephyrus relies on tax-deductible contributions from area patrons to assist with its expenses." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/mirable> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "Ensemble Mirable (Mirable - old French, meaning astonishing, strong, powerful) originated in 1996 at Indiana University's Early Music Institute while Ms. Blendulf and Ms. Kim were working toward graduate degrees. Since its inception, the group's focus has been on exploring the many variations in continuo performance across different baroque styles. Ensemble Mirable is a flexible performing entity, maintaining the ability to change and grow to meet the needs of different scale continuo demands. The members feel that in order to provide an exciting and yet elegant rendition of this repertoire, it is necessary to work within the composer's stylistic framework.\n\nIn 1998, Ensemble Mirable relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area where it continues to maintain an active concert schedule. In the summer of 2000, Ensemble Mirable won honorable mention in the second Dorian Group/Early Music America International Recording Competition for their performance of sonatas by Jean Zewalt Triemer. Goals in the near-term include the performance of cello and continuo works by Triemer, Geminiani, and works by various lesser-known baroque composers. Ultimately, Ensemble Mirable would like to stage larger scale works involving a continuo band, in collaboration with additional continuo instruments.\n\nOn Ensemble Mirable's latest work, Conversations Galantes, the core ensemble of JungHae Kim on harpsichord and Joanna Blendulf on viola de gamba was joined by several performers of note including Elizabeth Blumenstock on baroque violin; Greer Ellison on baroque flute, and William Skeen on baroque cello." .

I do session work, songwriting, and production projects. I have a well-outfitted home studio for songwriting and some production, and I also work with a nationally acclaimed pro studio here in Seattle. I cover country, country/rock, blues and jazz, both acoustic and electric, solo guitar and full-band arrangements.\n\nI like working with songwriters and can take almost any songwriter's demo (even face-to-face), turn it into a full-blown arrangement suitable for any studio in Nashville, select and hire appropriate instrumentation, produce the project, assist with artwork and duplication, and assist with marketing. If you're interested, drop me some email.\n\nI am a tone fanatic. I love Teles and Strats - have several. My main guitar is a late-model Telecaster that has been modified with a humbucker in the neck, a Duncan Nashville Strat pickup in the middle, and a Joe Barden Tele pickup in the bridge.\n\nI'm also using a late-model Dobro (for slide and fretted), a Larrivee C-19, a Martin OM28V, a Music Man 6 string bass, an early '60s ES-175, a Music Man ASAT, a Deering 6 string banjo, a Ramirez classical, and a Tacoma Papoose. I have several other guitars but these are the ones that get used the most.\n\nI own about 25 amps of both vintage and modern design. I frequently use a Groove Tubes Soul-O 75, 1x12 combo and an early '60s Fender Princeton Reverb. I'm pretty much a \"straight into the amp\" kinda guy (with high-quality cable, of course).\n\nThe studio is also equipped with many, high quality vintage and modern microphones." .

Soon after, in 2000, they brought in an old friend by the name of Rocky to lay down the drums. Each of them had other bands and projects going on, so for some time they only worked on the Pain Factor recordings whenever time would permit, but eventually they realized that they had something that was worth a lot more than just a side project.\n\nPain Factor has quickly established themselves as one of the S.F. Bay Area's heaviest new hard rock bands with their self-titled full-length release and live performances all over the Bay Area in 2004. Songs like Pull and Lunatic Lover deliver a sexy feel from the vocals with heavy sounds from Black Sabbath to White Zombie with a little bit of Nine Inch Nails influence. On the other hand, 8 Seconds, Hands of God and Devil's Blood are dark and heavy with a very serious and deliberate lyrical content that gives listeners a glimpse into some of Pain Factor's own personal experiences and demons. With heavy driven guitars, melodic yet aggressive vocals that are full of constant energy, and an extremely solid groove set forth by the bass and drums. Pain Factor is a S.F. Bay Area group of four musicians who have all been friends in different circles for many years that are sure to leave an impression on every one who sees and hears them." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/dac_crowell> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "I have always had trouble describing my work.\n\nThe problem is partly due to the fact that no easy 'pigeonhole' seems to exist for the music that I create. Some have tried to call it 'New Age'...but often it has too many abrasive elements, dark tones, and sometimes actual noise to fit that. Others have considered it 'Space Music'...which is a bit closer, although I'm not exactly sure what space my work would be describing. 'Ambient' therefore seems to fit best, as it does tend to be music that's suitable for a 'backdrop'...but at the same time, music that also describes a certain 'ambiance'. Music that's a snapshot of sorts of places, feelings, sensations, states of mind, and the like.\n\nYears and years ago, around the same time I was first learning piano as a small child, I also encountered the shortwave radio. It fascinated me...this box of strange sounds, pulsations, voices from other places phasing in and out. And then later in the 1960s, I heard the first stirrings of the Moog synthesizer...and others as well, as I attended a concert given by David Rosenboom while still in the second grade, with him performing his meditative style of electronics on a massive ARP 2500 rig. I suppose it was that formative experience that cemented what I was to try and do in my life.\n\nAs the 1970s progressed, I encountered a number of important musical 'signposts'...the work of Eno, Stockhausen, Cage, the music of the 'Krautrock' and punk scenes, and so on. All of these were, I think, important musical influences because they were not so much music that I only listened to, but music that made me want to try and do what I was hearing in it. I banged around some with some industrial/noise ideas, worked some in the early phases of the punk scene in Nashville (and yes, we did have one there), but it was also during this same period, around 1979-1980, that I started tinkering with tapes, delays, simple synths and sometimes just raw electronics. Everything that goes up to now seems to stem from there.\n\nI studied composition at Middle Tennessee State, under Dr. Thom Hutcheson, to whom I'm forever indebted because he allowed me a massive amount of rein to experiment in the electronic music studios there...as well as the commercial studios which were very much on par with typical industry-standard facilities of the day. These were critical times, with Hutch allowing me to try as much as I could, making important mistakes alongside successes. Later on, I studied under John Anthony Lennon at Tennessee, then with Salvatore Martirano at Illinois...both while I was in attendance there, and then off and on privately after a little 'falling-out' I had over some aesthetic differences with the rest of the composition faculty there. Sal taught me one thing that's been important...trust instinct and a belief in yourself and in your music. And from the early 1990s on, I have. Very much so.\n\nI went on from there, gradually building up a studio from a room-corner pile of gear into what I have now, which is requiring the complete remodeling of the walk-up attic of our rural home. In a decade's time, it grew like topsy. As did my music, as I explored deeper and deeper introspections in my 'ambient' work, and I explored the ranges of rhythmic expression in early IDM-style techno. But throughout both, there was and still is a strain of sound that owes its origins to the avant-garde. I have never really gotten away from it, and I don't think it would be in my best interests to try. It's the little bit of cayenne pepper that adds a 'zing' to what would otherwise be a typical dish. And given that I like spicy things, well...\n\nIn the past few years, I also was privileged to study with Karlheinz Stockhausen, at his Courses for New Music in Germany. It was not so much an experience of learning basics, but an affirmation that I was pursuing the right directions. Everything that he said or discussed, I already believed or had arrived at a similar conclusion myself. It was very liberating, I said at the time, and from those days on, I've felt a freedom to take what I feel, hear, envision, and set this down as best I can, following instinct, capturing the immediate 'now' of a work.\n\nAnd it's that 'now'...that is the key here. Framing the 'now', following a sense of the true nature of things, relying on instinct and a fluid mind...all of these things are my guideposts, along with so many things I've heard and experienced. Works that capture a certain 'now', such as \"Mendota\" and its impression of sunset colors sliding across a vast frozen lake and snowscape...or \"SPCTR\", which attempts to magnify the 'world inside a single tone'...these and so many other 'nows' are the ones I try to paint as best as I can in the sounds that I use. And perhaps the results evoke other things, as everyone's experience of something as fundamentally communicating as music is colored by their own experiences in so many ways.\n\nIn Zen disciplines, one hears of the concept of 'samu'...work as meditation or practice. And I view what I do, when I'm creating or performing, or even tweaking the settings on an existing work...as a manner of that same practice. But it's a practice with an open mind, receptive, waiting for something to sound from beyond the fundamental self and not merely 'just doing something, no matter what'. Creativity within a mindful state, and continuously trying to seize the 'now' in a work...it's not the easiest way I can think of to work, nor the easiest way that I have worked over the years. But it is the right way for me, as trying to be a 'New Music star' only ever led to a lot of ego-driven angst and annoyance. That's not who I am, not my nature, not my music.\n\nWhere from here, then? Who can say? Not me. None of those 'nows' have happened yet, so I suppose I'll simply have to wait for them so that I can encounter each one. I encourage you to wait and see what happens, as well." .

EF has almost single-handedly returned rock to its most basic and savage roots, the way it was meant to be. They have been receiving international acclaim for their exciting brand of Punk Rock and Roll, done with the great intensity of such bands as the Stooges, MC5, Dead Boys, NY Dolls, Damned, Black Flag, Misfits, AC/DC, Kiss, Cheap Trick, Aerosmith, etc. In addition to playing the most dynamic, ravenous, and menacing rock you've ever heard, EF recognizes the importance of integrity. From giving proper nods to the architects of street-level rock (Iggy and the Stooges, Dead Boys, AC/DC), to fiercely supporting DIY labels to their constant efforts to put fans first ahead of profit, EF is championing the cause to bring Rock back to the people and out of the hands of corporations. EF aren't young or pretty, and in case you haven't noticed neither is Real Rock & Roll. EF aren't here to be your girlfriend, they're here to ROCK! While stupid critics might say 'but, it's only rock n roll, its nothing new', EF fans are saying \"Damn, right!\" as they embrace the best of what's loud, fast, and rules from the last 30 years distilled down to one single organism. EF are one a mission to revitalize Rock & Roll and save people from the boredom of \"alternative music\". EF shows are intense, exciting, and inspiring.\n\nEF have been well reviewed in such magazines as Kerrang, Metal Hammer, Rock Sound, Alternative Press, Hit Parader, Seconds, Thrasher, Lollipop, Tail Spins, Rue Morgue, Maximum Rock N Roll, Flipside, Big Takeover, Paper, Aquarian Weekly, and countless European & Japanese magazines as well.

EF played the 1997 Warp tour. They plan to tour Japan and Australia soon. EF have played with Danzig, Monster Magnet, Marilyn Manson, Hole, Social Distortion, The Misfits, Dead Kennedys, Dictators, Poison Idea, SOD, Joe Strummer, The Dwarves, Nebula, Orange Goblin, Electric Wizard, Turbonegro, Hellacopters, and many more. One of Joey Ramone's favorites, EF can count many other bands as fans of their music as well (Jon Spencer, Metallica, Monster Magnet, etc.), and they have returned the favor via the popular \"A Fistful of Rock & Roll\" compilation series, produced by EF guitarist, Sal Canzonieri.\n\nThe EF invasion has begun with Dark Horse publishing a 160 page book on EF. In 2004, EF will have a world wide art gallery and book signing tour for the upcoming book, \"Electric Frankenstein!\", as well as two fantastic EF clothing lines being done by Sourpuss Clothing and Lucky 13 clothing, and EF skateboards, toys, and videogames in the works too!\n\nEF play vintage equipment exclusively by Gibson, Ibanez, Fender, Ludwig, Ampeg, and Marshall and are sponsored by D'Addario guitar strings and GHS bass strings." .

<http://dbtune.org/magnatune/artist/shiva_in_exile> <http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/olb> "A journey from middle to far east echoed by simple world rhythms and resounding through an ambient backdrop.\n\n\"Ethnic\" is an enveloping sound rich with atmosphere and the pulsating life of percussion -- an almost gothic expanse warmed with the vocals and instruments of distant lands.\n\nShiva In Exile enriches the appeal of world music with the presence of ambient. We prefer the term \"World Ambient\" as it is most descriptive of the music.\n\nStefan Hertrich (vocalist and songwriter of \"Darkseed\" and \"Betray My Secrets\") is the composer and responsible for all arrangements on the album." .
